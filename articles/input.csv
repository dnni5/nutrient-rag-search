Greater understanding is needed of the impact of social determinants—including maternal education—on child oral health. This is a cross-sectional analysis of a convenience sample of families of 458 indigenous Ecuadorian children aged 6 months through 6 years from 2011–2013. Data was collected by mother interviews and child dental and anthropometric examinations. Multivariate logistic and Zero-Inflated-Poisson regression analyses assessed associations between years of maternal education and maternal-child oral health practices and child oral health outcomes. Each additional year of maternal education was significantly (p < 0.05) associated with some healthier practices including greater likelihood of mothers and children drinking milk daily (OR 1.20; 95% CI 1.08, 1.34); and less healthy practices including greater likelihood of bottle-feeding children with sugary liquids (OR 1.14; 95% CI 1.06, 1.22) and to older age, giving children sweets daily, calming children with a bottle or sweets, and less likelihood of helping brush their children’s teeth (OR 0.93; 95% CI 0.88, 0.98). Each year of maternal education had a small but statistically non-significant influence on increasing the odds of children being among those who are cavity-free (OR 1.03; 95% CI 0.92, 1.16). Interventions to improve health outcomes should focus not just on maternal education but also address social and commercial determinants of health through nutrition and oral health education, as well as policies to reduce sugar and ensure universal access to oral health care. © 2022 by the authors.",early childhood caries; ecuador; maternal education; maternal-child health; nutrition; oral health; public health; social determinants of health,Cross-Sectional Studies; Dental Caries; Ecuador; Female; Humans; Indigenous Peoples; Oral Health; Ecuador; accessibility; child health; disease incidence; health care; health education; indigenous population; maternal health; nutritional requirement; oral health; public health; Article; attitude to health; body mass; bottle feeding; breast feeding; child; child health; child nutrition; childhood; cross-sectional study; dental caries; drinking; Ecuador; female; food quality; health care policy; health education; human; human experiment; interview; major clinical study; maternal welfare; medical student; milk; mother; mouth hygiene; obesity; outcome assessment; Poisson regression; pregnancy; prenatal care; prevalence; public health; questionnaire; social determinants of health; tooth brushing; vegetable; dental caries; health,"B.

Objective: To describe the differences in comprehension and use of the new nutrition label in 2 different ethnic populations residing in a limited resource area of central Ecuador. Methods: A total of 394 women (18-75 years, 54.8% indigenous and 45.2% mixed-race mestizas) were randomly selected in the Chimborazo Province and were requested by a questionnaire to provide information regarding their awareness and comprehension of the traffic light nutritional labeling system and personal use of the food label in food selection. Results: Indigenous women had a high percentage who lacked any formal education (43.5%) and a greater proportion were not aware of the labeling system when compared with the mestizas (84.3% vs 46%; P =.001). In both groups, the main reason for not reading labels was lack of understanding of its meaning (50% indigenous vs 32.7% mestiza; P <.05). The reported use of the labeling system for food choices was low - on average, 32% of the mestizas and 5% of the indigenous women reported using nutrition label information to guide their purchase and consumption of packaged food items. Conclusion: The use of nutritional labeling is low in both mestiza and indigenous Ecuadorians, although higher among the mestizas. Among the indigenous women, mostly likely owing to less education, limited nutrition-related health knowledge, and higher risk for food insecurity, the utility of the new traffic light food label is limited. © The Author(s) 2016.",food policy; Latin America; nutrition policy; public health,Andes; Chimborazo; Ecuador; Latin America; ethnic group; food consumption; health education; health policy; indigenous population; nutritive value; public health; questionnaire survey; traditional knowledge; attitude to health; awareness; comprehension; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; Ecuador; education; female; food insecurity; human; major clinical study; male; nutrition policy; public health; questionnaire; race; randomized controlled trial; adult; aged; article; ethnic group; human experiment,"C.L.

There is limited information on the correct management of enteral feeding in home patients. Objectives: To evidence the contribution of using enteral nutrition education specifically designed for a patient with Wolf Hirschhorn Syndrome to the improvement of the nutritional status. Methods: This research includes the follow up of a female adolescent, diagnosed with Wolf Hirschhorn Syndrome who had an initial body weight of 25.8 kg, and 134 cm of length. Medical history includes swallowing disorder, absence of chewing reflex, enteral feeding via gastrostomy, gastroesophageal reflux, constipation, absence of motor, intellectual and language skills. Enteral feeding was tracked for 8 weeks. Results: We found that nutrition education promotes a significant improvement in the nutritional status of patients with Wolf Hirschhorn Syndrome. Body weight gain, bicipital and tricipital folds were increased by 1 kg, 2 mm and 2.3 mm, respectively; and also an increased intake of micro and macronutrients (p<0.001). Discussion: It is essential to educate the staff in charge of feeding home patients with Wolf Hirschhorn Syndrome using a guide. Conclusions: Enteral feeding at home was successful using the designed tool for the specific context. © 2020 Sociedad espanola de dietetica. All rights reserved.",,,"D.

This study aimed to analyze the associations of relative humidity of residence, lifestyles, and MetS among Ecuadorian adults. Data from 6024 people aged 20 to 60 years were obtained from an Ecuador national population-based health and nutrition survey (i.e., ENSANUT-ECU, 2012) and the mean annual relative humidity (%) from the Ecuador National Institute for Meteorology and Hydrology (2012). Odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for MetS according to groups of relative humidity were calculated using multiple logistic regression. Living in high relative humidity (>80%) increased ORs of reduced high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (1.25; 95 % CI, 1.06–1.56) and MetS (OR = 1.20; 95 % CI,1.01–1.42) in women. Furthermore, physically active men living in high relative humidity showed lower OR of elevated triglycerides (0.56; 95 % CI,0.37–0.85) while menopausal women living in high relative humidity showed increased ORs of MetS (5.42; 95 % CI, 1.92–15.27), elevated blood pressure (3.10; 95 % CI, 1.15–8.35), and increased waist circumference (OR = 1.34; 95 % CI, 1.09–1.63). Our results show that residence in high relative humidity and menopausal status increase ORs of MetS and its components in Ecuadorian women; however, physical activity significantly reduces the OR of elevated triglycerides in men. The obtained findings may help make public health policies regarding environmental humidity management, nutritional education, menopausal care, and physical activity promotion to prevent the onset of MetS among Ecuadorian adults. © 2020 by the authors.

It is clear that in Latin America the School Feeding Program (PAE) is of great importance due to its objectives, coverage and the resources allocated by the State for its operation, making it one of the most important social programs in the region. This research has the following objectives: - Description on nutritional strategies that have improved school nutrition indices in Ecuador, Bolivia and Peru. - Identification of foods that do not contribute to adequate nutrition for children. Material and methods: A bibliographic search was carried out in databases of the United Nations (UN), Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and Ministries of Education of South American countries. To complement the research, articles were also searched in the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) and Scopus, using the terms: nutritional strategies, child nutrition, schoolchildren in South America, malnutrition, PAE. The present research applies the historical and comparative description of certain school nutrition projects that have been implemented from 2008 to 2018 in the Andean countries. Results: South American countries, especially the Andean countries have reformed their school nutrition processes, thus also improving social aspects such as economy and education, based on equity strategies that promote the incorporation and stability of students to the academic sector. Discussion/conclusions: The PAE, work under the comprehensive protection approach, contributing mainly to the guarantee of two fundamental rights: education and food for children and adolescents enrolled in the public education system. © 2022 Sociedad espanola de dietetica.

Methods We developed an educational and behavioral intervention that included games, singing, and storytelling. Children were recruited from municipal preschools in Cuenca and were enrolled in the pilot intervention (PI) (N=155) for the 2015-2016 school year, which consisted of a 3-month in-school program. For the 2016-2017 school year, a separate group of children was enrolled in the enhanced intervention (EI) (N=152), which consisted of a 7- month program at both school and home. Results Parents in both groups reported a post-intervention reduction in their child's daily at-home consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages (PI: -23.2%, P < .001; EI: -16.8%, P < .001). Additional beneficial effects of the EI not observed with the PI were an increase in drinking water daily at home (+8.3%, P = .04) and eating fruits and vegetables daily for snacks at home (+21.8%, P < .001), a reduction in excessive weekend screen time (-7.6%, P = .03), and a reduction of 0.11 in mean BMI-for-age z score (P = .003). When comparing the PI and EI, the EI was associated with a greater difference in mean BMI-for-age z score (-0.25; P < .001) and fruit and vegetable consumption (+15.9%; P = .01). Conclusion Our preschool-based intervention appeared to be successful in promoting healthy lifestyle habits, especially when combined with a household component. Further research is needed to determine if the intervention had long-term effects, as well as to adapt it for different settings. © 2018 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).",,"Beverages; Child, Preschool; Ecuador; Exercise; Feeding Behavior; Female; Health Promotion; Healthy Diet; Humans; Male; Pediatric Obesity; Pilot Projects; School Health Services; Sedentary Behavior; beverage; childhood obesity; Ecuador; exercise; feeding behavior; female; health promotion; healthy diet; human; male; pilot study; preschool child; procedures; school health service","V.

Objectives: This study aims to explore the nutritional concerns of the urban Kichwas community residing in the Andes highlands of Ecuador. Study design: This is a qualitative study. Methods: Eight focus groups were conducted with Kichwas men and women in November 2015 in the Imbabura province of the Andes in Ecuador. Data analysis: Applied thematic analysis was used to analyze findings regarding nutrition. Results: The participants shared concerns regarding increased intake of fast food, poor meal timing, and a shift in the child's food preferences that rejects traditional foods. They attributed these concerns to urbanization resulting from an increase in dual-income households and a loss of cultural identity. Conclusions: Synergistic cultural factors are related to nutritional concerns voiced by the urban Kichwas community. Public health implications: Syndemic theory is a useful interpretive lens regarding nutritional trends within the Kichwas communities as they relate to the increased risk of chronic disease. © 2019 The Royal Society for Public Health",Andes highlands; Desculturización; Indigenous communities; Kichwas; Market Integration among Indigenous; Nutrition transition; Syndemic theory; Urbanization,Adult; Chronic Disease; Ecuador; Female; Focus Groups; Humans; Male; Nutritional Status; Population Groups; Urban Population; Urbanization; Andes; Ecuador; cultural identity; food market; health risk; indigenous population; nutrition; social theory; urban population; urbanization; Article; cultural factor; dietary intake; Ecuador; ethnography; fast food; feeding behavior; female; food preference; household income; human; indigenous people; male; nutritional assessment; qualitative analysis; Quechua (people); risk assessment; thematic analysis; urbanization; adult; chronic disease; Ecuador; information processing; nutritional status; population group; urban population,"V.A.

Evidence indicates that recent changes are enabling corporations to promote their brands, gain tax deductions, oversee public policy and set priorities, allocate resources, and decide on implementation of the country's child malnutrition strategy. Further, corporate representatives are active members of an advisory council, free from scrutiny or accountability, while being privy to undisclosed government information. Moreover, a UN agency (the World Food Program) engaged in corporate promotion of highly processed foods, illustrating the breadth of Ecuador's corporate influence scheme. Improved regulations should set clear limits to the influence of food and beverage industries in national nutrition policy, while following transparency laws in the composition and operation of Ecuador's child malnutrition strategy and related efforts. © 2023 The Author(s)",Commercial determinants of health; Corporate influence; Ecuador; Health policy; Private interest; Public health nutrition,beverage; corporate organization; decision making; drug industry; food industry; government; health care policy; health care system; human; institutionalization; law; malnutrition; nutrition; nutrition policy; processed food; public health; public policy; public sector; Review; tax; tax deduction; vaccination; World Food Programme,"I.

The objective of this research was to analyze the eating habits (EH), physical activity (PA), and sleep quality (SQ) of older adults in the rural parish of San José de Minas in Quito, Ecuador. Three validated questionnaires were used: the Pittsburgh PSQI for SQ, IPAQ for PA, and frequency of consumption for EH. The results revealed high consumption of refined flours and sugar (70% at least once a day), low intake of whole grains, fish, and olive oil, and considerable consumption of fruits and water. Fifty percent of respondents engage in moderate physical activity and 24% in low physical activity, while 90% of older adults have poor sleep quality. These results indicate a problem in the integral health of the population that does not allow older adults to have a good old age. Health campaigns should be developed to increase physical activity, encourage a better diet, and thus, improve the quality of sleep.

The researchers assessed the effectiveness of a Positive Deviance (PD)/Hearth community-based intervention using local foods to improve infant and young children's nutrition. Design A quasi-experimental nonrandomized study was conducted between March and October, 2009. Setting The intervention and study were implemented in the Ecuadorian highlands provinces of Chimborazo and Tungurahua. Participants Eighty mother–child pairs in 6 intervention communities and 184 mother–child pairs in 9 comparison communities. Intervention Mothers met in participatory peer-led PD/Hearth cooking and nutrition education sessions for 12 days. Main Outcome Measures Dietary intake and nutritional status were collected at baseline and 6-month follow-up. Analysis Multiple linear and logistic regression were used for growth outcomes, and ANCOVA for mean dietary intakes. Results Mothers in the intervention were 1.3–5.7 times more likely to feed their children the promoted foods (P < .05). Children in the intervention consumed a higher percentage of recommended intakes for iron, zinc, vitamin A, protein, and energy (P < .05) at follow-up and had improvements in weight-for-age z-score (β = .17; 95% confidence interval, 0.01–0.31). Likelihood of underweight was reduced for children in the intervention (odds ratio = 0.36; 95% confidence interval, 0.13–0.96) Conclusions and Implications The PD/Hearth interventions support mothers to improve infant and young children's nutrition practices and reduce underweight. © 2016 Society for Nutrition Education and Behavior",child; complementary feeding; local foods; nutrition intervention; Positive Deviance/Hearth; underweight,Adult; Community Health Services; Diet; Ecuador; Female; Health Education; Health Promotion; Humans; Infant; Male; Mothers; Nutritional Status; Nutritive Value; Young Adult; adult; community care; diet; Ecuador; female; health education; health promotion; human; infant; male; mother; nutritional status; nutritional value; procedures; statistics and numerical data; young adult,"M.L.

Evidence from high-income countries has reported negative or null associations between HFI and physical activity (PA) in children. It remains uncertain whether the same is true of those from low-and middle-income countries like Ecuador whose environmental and socio-demographic characteristics are distinct from those of high-income countries. We aimed to investigate the association of HFI with PA, sedentary behaviour (SB) and anthropometric indicators in children. Design: Cross-sectional analysis of data from the nationally representative 2018 Ecuadorian National Health and Nutrition Survey. Data were collected on HFI, PA, SB, socio-demographic characteristics and measured height and weight. Unadjusted and adjusted linear, log-binomial and multinomial logistic regression analyses assessed the relationship of HFI with PA, SB, stunting and BMI-for-Age. Setting: Ecuador. Participants: 23 621 children aged 5-17 years. Results: Marginal and moderate-severe HFI was prevalent in 24 % and 20 % of the households, respectively. HFI was not associated with PA, SB, stunting nor underweight. Moderate-severe HFI was associated with a lower odds of overweight and obesity. However, adjustment for household assets attenuated this finding for overweight (adjusted OR:0·90, 95 % CI: 0·77, 1·05) and obesity (adjusted OR: 0·88, 95 % CI: 0·71, 1·08). Conclusion: HFI is a burden in Ecuadorian households, but is not associated with PA, SB nor anthropometric indicators in children aged 5-17 years. However, a concerning prevalence of insufficient PA was reported, emphasising the critical need for evidence-based interventions aimed at promoting PA and reducing SB. © The Author(s), 2024.

Factors such as the use of electronic devices, academic pressures, lack of resources and family habits contribute to this problem. Promoting healthy habits is crucial, since physical activity and a balanced diet positively impact academic performance, emotional well-being and disease prevention. The participation of families and educational centers, through specific programs and school policies, is essential to address sedentary lifestyle. Continuously evaluating these initiatives is essential to measure their impact. The objective of this research is to know the healthy habits in relation to physical activity and nutrition in adolescent students in Ecuador, as well as the support of families and educational institutions. A descriptive and correlational quantitative research design has been used. A sample of 2877 adolescent students from Ecuador has been taken. Data collection was carried out using a validated questionnaire. The results reflect the importance of understanding the determinants of physical activity in Ecuadorian adolescents. By applying these findings in health policies, sedentary lifestyle can be combated and an active lifestyle promoted. A deeper understanding of the factors that influence physical activity allows for the development of more effective interventions adapted to the needs of this population, benefiting the long-term health of adolescents and contributing to the general well-being of the community. © 2024 Federacion Espanola de Docentes de Educacion Fisica.

Significant differences were noticed between nutritional knowledge and socio-demographic characteristics such as city living (AOR = 2.42, 95% CI: 1.74-3.37) and female education (AOR = 1.62, 95% CI: 1.14-2.21). Fat and oil; roots and tubers and flesh-based foods were the most frequently consumed food groups. The food consumption score was, however, good, and was associated with nutrition knowledge (AOR = 2.1, 95% CI: 1.34-3.26); area of residence (AOR = 9.4, 95% CI: 5.80-15.30); knowledge of daily food choices (AOR = 1.7, 95 CI: 1. In this study, households had poor nutritional knowledge and adequate food consumption scores were associated with demographic variables. Nutritional education programs are required to raise awareness. � 2024, Texila International Journal (TIJ).

In healthcare, food recognition is valuable for individuals to monitor their daily food intake and manage their diet effectively. It also aids dietitians and nutritionists in creating personalized meal plans for patients based on their nutritional requirements and preferences. The objective of this research was to develop software capable of recognizing and predicting the nutritional information of commonly consumed fruits and vegetables in Turkey. Basic nutrition data for each food item was collected and organized. A dataset comprising 9,000 food images was gathered, encompassing 200 images for each food item. To train the images, deep learning (DL) algorithms such as GoogleNet, ResNet-50, and Inception-v3 were utilized on platforms like Matlab and.NET Core. Additionally, 900 food images were reserved for external validation purposes. The DL algorithms achieved excellent accuracy, with all models surpassing 98.3% accuracy in predicting food categories. Notably, the Inception-v3 algorithm outperformed the others, achieving an accuracy of 99.1% during the testing phase. Consequently, the Inception-v3 algorithm was chosen to develop software for food recognition and nutrition analysis, intended for both computers and smartphones. The software can be relied upon for food recognition and nutrition analysis, making it highly valuable in healthcare, particularly in tracking the dietary intake of patients with chronic conditions like diabetes, heart disease, or obesity. The system can effectively track the types and quantities of foods consumed, providing personalized feedback to both patients and healthcare providers. � (2023), (North University of Baia Mare).

Potassium intake may reduce the risk of HTN through sodium excretion and reduce inflammation and oxidative stress. This study is aimed at investigating the association between air pollutants and HTN and whether these associations differ based on the potassium intake data of Korean adults from the 2012�2016 Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES). This cross-sectional study used data from KNHANES (2012�2016) combined with annual air pollutant data from the Ministry of Environment using administrative units. We included 15,373 adults who responded to the semi-food frequency questionnaire. Associations between ambient PM10, SO2, NO2, CO, and O3 with HTN according to potassium intake were assessed using the survey logistic regression model for complex samples analysis. After adjusting for potential covariates such as, age, sex, education level, smoking status, family income, alcohol consumption, body mass index (BMI), exercise status, and survey year, as the air pollutant score considering the five air pollutants increased (severe air pollution), the prevalence of HTN increased in a dose-dependent manner (p for trend < 0.001). Meanwhile, in the adults with higher potassium intake and who were exposed to lowest levels of air pollutants score (score = 0), the ORs of HTN were significantly lower (OR = 0.56, 95% CI: 0.32�0.97). In conclusion, our study suggests that exposure to air pollutants may increase the prevalence of HTN among Korean adults. However, high potassium intake may help prevent HTN caused by air pollutants. � 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Air pollutants; Cross-sectional study; Hypertension; KNHANES; Korea; Potassium,Adult; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Cross-Sectional Studies; Humans; Hypertension; Inflammation; Nutrition Surveys; Particulate Matter; Potassium; Republic of Korea; Sodium; Korea; potassium; sodium; adult; atmospheric pollution; excretion; health survey; hypertension; pollution exposure; potassium; adult; air pollutant; air pollution; cross-sectional study; human; hypertension; inflammation; nutrition; particulate matter; South Korea,"H.J.

We aimed to explore the correlation between urinary iodine concentration (UIC) and CAD. Data from 15 793 US adults in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2003-2018) were analysed. We conducted multivariable logistic regression models and fitted smoothing curves to study the correlation between UIC and CAD. Furthermore, we performed subgroup analysis to investigate possible effect modifiers between them. We found a J-shaped association between UIC and CAD, with an inflection point at Lg UIC = 2�65 g/l. This result indicated a neutral association (OR 0�89; 95 % CI 0�68, 1�16) between UIC and CAD as Lg UIC < 2�65 g/l, but the per natural Lg [UIC] increment was OR 2�29; 95 % CI 1�53, 3�43 as Lg UIC ? 2�65 g/l. An interaction between diabetes and UIC might exist. The increase in UIC results in an increase in CAD prevalence (OR 1�84, 95 % CI 1�32, 2�58) in diabetes but results in little to no difference in non-diabetes (OR 0�98, 95 % CI 0�77, 1�25). The J-shaped correlation between UIC and CAD and the interaction between diabetes and UIC should be confirmed in a prospective study with a series of UIC measurements. If excessive iodine precedes CAD, then this new finding could guide clinical practice and prevent iodine deficiency from being overcorrected.  � The Author(s), 2023.

Particularly, it seeks to determine the level of dietary energy consumption (DEC) and other macronutrients intake. In addition, it estimates the Engel ratios and income elasticity of food demand. A sample of about 668 households was selected from Khartoum State to collect the primary data during the year 2017. Primary data was collected through two types of questionnaires, the structured household questi onnai re, and the 24-hour food recal l questi onnai re. The data was analyzed using descriptive statistics and One-way ANOVA Table. The outcomes prove that income contributes extensively to DEC as well as intakes of protein, carbohydrates, and fat. The households in the lowest income quintile spend a high monetary value to purchase foods when compared with households in other income quintiles. The Engel ratios exhibit that the share of food consumption from the total income for the lowest income quintile is about 62%, which is higher relative to the highest income quintile (43.6%). In addition, Engel ratios varies significantly among the income quintiles at level 1%. The income elasticity of food demand in dietary energy consumption is higher for the lowest income quintile (0.49) than the highest income quintile (0.23). This indicates that a little increase in income will contribute significantly to better nutritional status for the lowest income quintile. Eventually, the paper recommends improving income earnings through income-based policies to reduce the level of food deprivation. The government should adopt specific market policies that focus on the low-income level to enhance access to nutritious foods. � 2022 The Author(s).

Choosing the right nutrients as part of a healthy diet is vital for the prevention of so-called non-communicable diseases (NCDs) like diabetes or cancer. A big number of applications are available to smartphone users around the world including so-called mHealth apps (mobile health applications). Part of this mHealth application space are also apps that aim to educate people about nutrition and help them change their eating habits as part of a healthy diet. However, in the author's opinion, state-of-the-art applications still lack to motivate people to eat healthy foods especially for combating the NCDs by delivering specific food information. Therefore, the authors of this paper propose the ""Nutrition Garden""app that was created together with the help of field experts and users of the target group. It is a mobile application that motivates, supports, and encourages people to eat healthy by consuming a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, fish oils, etc. to prevent NCDs, as well as tightening up the knowledge on nutritional science for its users. Together with using gamification elements to help users stay motivated over an extended period and at the same time focus on curated food items it provides, in the author's opinion, a novel approach for an mHealth application in the domain of nutritional science. � 2023 ACM.",gamification; health promotion; mHealth; nutrition,Diseases; mHealth; Oils and fats; 'current; Applications-space; Eating habits; Gamification; Health promotion; Healthy diet; Making decision; Mobile health application; Non-communicable disease; Smart phones; Nutrition,,,Association for Computing Machinery,,979-840070071-2,,,English,ACM Int.

Funded by the UK Prevention Research Partnership (UKRI), we have established a UK school food system network. The overarching aim was to build a community to work towards a more health promoting food and nutrition system in UK schools. The network has brought together a team from a range of disciplines, while inclusion of non-academic users and other stakeholders, such as pupils and parents, has allowed the co-development of research priorities and questions. This network has used a combination of workshops, working groups and pump-priming projects to explore the school food system, as well as creating a systems map of the UK school food system, and conducting network analysis of the newly established network. Through understanding the current food system and building network expertise, we hope to advance research and policy around food in schools. Further funding has been achieved based on these findings, working in partnership with policy makers and schools, whilst a Nutrition Society Special Interest Group has been established to ensure maximum engagement and future sustainability of the network. This review will describe the key findings and progress to date based on the work of the network, as well as a summary of the current literature, identification of knowledge gaps and areas of debate, according to key elements of the school food system. � 2024 Cambridge University Press.

Food insecurity, affecting approximately 10% of the U.S. population, with up to 40% or higher in some communities, is associated with higher rates of chronic conditions and inversely associated with diet quality. Nutrition interventions implemented at food pantries are an effective strategy to increase healthy food choices and improve health outcomes for people experiencing food and nutrition insecurity. Supporting Wellness at Pantries (SWAP), a stoplight nutrition ranking system, can facilitate healthy food procurement and distribution at pantries. Purpose. Guided by the RE-AIM Framework, this study assesses the implementation and outcomes of SWAP as nutritional guidance and institutional policy intervention, to increase procurement and distribution of healthy foods in pantries. Method. Mixed-methods evaluation included observations, process forms, and in-depth interviews. Food inventory assessments were conducted at baseline and 2-year follow-up. Results. Two large pantries in New Haven, Connecticut, collectively reaching more than 12,200 individuals yearly, implemented SWAP in 2019. Implementation was consistent prepandemic at both pantries. Due to COVID-mandated distribution changes, pantries adapted SWAP implementation during the pandemic while still maintaining the �spirit of SWAP.� One pantry increased the percentage of Green foods offered. Challenges to healthy food distribution are considered. Discussion. This study has implications for policy, systems, and environmental changes. It shows the potential for SWAP adoption at pantries, which can serve as a guide for continued healthy food procurement and advocacy. Maintaining the �spirit of SWAP� shows promising results for food pantries looking to implement nutrition interventions when standard practice may not be possible. � 2022 Society for Public Health Education.","chronic disease prevention; community intervention; food insecurity; food pantries; health promotion; nutrition; nutrition security; program implementation; RE-AIM, REACH: Racial and Ethnic Approaches to Community Health; SWAP: Supporting Wellness at Pantries",COVID-19; Food; Food Assistance; Food Preferences; Food Supply; Humans; Nutritional Status; catering service; food; food assistance; food preference; human; nutritional status,"S.I.

The relationship between environmental pressure and dietary structure has influenced the quantity and spatial distribution of China's food supply and demand, but it has not been evaluated. Our research centered on the security of China's food nutrition�resources�food (NRF) system, considering the inherent relationship between food security, nutritional health, and resource security. The following are the study's findings: (1) The Chinese population is rapidly changing from a diet focused on grains to a more diverse diet. Between 1990 and 2019, the dietary quality and nutritional status of Chinese individuals have vastly improved. In terms of nutrient levels, discrepancies between urban and rural resident persist, with urban residents consuming a diet that is closer to the ideal structure. However, the structure of rural residents' food consumption is diversifying, and the gap between urban and rural residents is gradually narrowing. (2) From 2000 to 2019, the pressure, status, and response indices of China's NRF system all show an upward trend, and the security of the NRF system has steadily grown. The magnitude of change in the response index exceeded that of the state index, which exceeded that of the pressure index. This indicates that the increase in the pressure and state indices of the NRF system was primarily attributable to the effectiveness of policy efforts. � The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2023.",Food security; Food system; Nutrition security; Resource security; Stress�state�response,China; food security; food supply; nutritional status; spatial distribution,"X.

However, many of these plants are also used as timber. Wild food species need to be identified and their food�wood use interactions need to be well understood for the development of conservation strategies, as species with the potential to improve food and nutrition security may be threatened by destructive extraction. This systematic review recorded and compiled nutritional information on woody plant species native to Brazil that are used by local populations for food and timber purposes, seeking to identify which species have a high overlap between food and timber uses as well as a high nutritional potential. A total of 635 woody species with timber and/or food uses were identified. Of this total, at least 42 species find application in all timber use categories analyzed in this study, being considered versatile. Comparison of ethnobiological and nutritional data revealed nine versatile species for which nutritional composition information was available, among which three stood out in terms of macronutrient contents, namely Anacardium occidentale L., Bauhinia cheilantha (Bong.) Steud., and Eugenia pyriformis Cambess. Many versatile species classified as threatened or in decline have not been the focus of nutritional studies, which signals the need for greater nutritional research efforts.

We used data on social determinants of health to identify priority communities and funded 25 contractors to recruit and engage worksites in those communities. We employed a pre/post quasi-experimental design and used the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention�s Worksite Health ScoreCard to assess implementation of nutrition and physical activity strategies. Contractors collaborated with partners to conduct pre- and postassessments at 313 worksites. Worksites were successful at implementing all except one strategy; implementation doubled for eight strategies and tripled for three. We used weighted scores to incorporate strength of the evidence-base and level of impact into our analysis; increases in strategy implementation were statistically significant in worksites that provided places to purchase food and beverages and in those that did not. Our study revealed several important recommendations for practice. Use available data to prioritize communities experiencing health disparities and identify PSE change strategies to increase access to nutritious foods and physical activity opportunities.

Specifically, we assess household resilience to food insecurity and its relation to future food security. We use two survey rounds collected during the pandemic � before and after the second wave of the pandemic�from the vulnerable population living in slums in Tanzania. The findings reveal that many households have low resilience to shock. We find that COVID-19 reduced access to food in 68% of the households and left about 30% without any food to eat. We also find that micronutrient consumption significantly declined among households who reported food insecurity following the second wave of COVID-19. We also find that the probability of experiencing food insecurity reduced with the initial resilience level. High resilient households have a higher likelihood of maintaining or diversifying more their diets even when are exposed to shock. The disruption of income-generating activities was found as a leading pathway through which COVID-19 affected household food security. The findings suggest that with persisting COVID-19 pandemic and the low level of micronutrients consumption, the nutrition of children and adult household members of the vulnerable population is at stake. � 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.",COVID-19; Food and nutrition insecurity; Household resilience; Tanzania,Tanzania; Food supply; Nutrients; Nutrition; Trace elements; Exposed to; Food and nutrition insecurity; Food insecurity; Food security; Household food; Household members; Household resilience; Income generating activities; Tanzania; COVID-19; food security; nutrition; trace element; COVID-19,"F.M.P.

This study aimed to assess the efficacy of school-integrated interventions on nutrition-health knowledge and nutritional status among adolescent girls. A quasi-experimental study design involved 342 female adolescents in the entire study series from 2021-2023. The intervention school was provided nutrition-health education by trained teachers plus nutrition-health services at the Adolescent Girls� Integrated Health Post (Posyandu) (n=262); the comparison only received nutrition-health education from trained teachers at their school (n=80). Nutrition-health knowledge (standard questionnaire), nutrients and dietary intake (food recall form 2x24 hours and food frequency questionnaire), and nutritional status were collected through anthropometric and biochemical assessments in both groups. There was an increase in the mean value of all aspects of nutrition-health knowledge. This increase was higher in the intervention group. The malnutrition biomarkers decreased significantly in the intervention school comprised of anemia was 3.4%, Chronic Energy Deficiency (CED) was 24.1%, severe stunted at 0.8%, and wasting at 1.6%, but overweight increased by 1.2%. In the comparison school, only CED decreased significantly by 26.2%, while anemia, severe stunting, wasting, and overweight increased significantly. In conclusion, school-integrated interventions were more effective than nutritional education alone in improving nutrition-health knowledge and nutritional status among adolescent girls. � 2023 The Author(s).

However, malnutrition identification through nutrition screening is not routinely performed in Malaysia's health clinics due to no specific nutrition screening guideline and validated tool in this setting. This study aimed to develop a nutrition screening guideline for older patients and assess its feasibility for use by healthcare staff in health clinic setting. Methods: This study was conducted in three phases. In Phase I, needs assessment was conducted amongst healthcare staff. Development of nutrition screening guideline in Phase II involved scoping review and validation amongst six experts and twelve healthcare staff. In Phase III, twenty-two healthcare staff participated in feasibility assessment using in-depth interviews after completing nutrition screening in older patients. Interview data was analysed thematically using NVivo Software 12.0. Results: A Malay language version of nutrition screening guideline in A4-sized with 31 pages was developed and validated. Items with a content validity index ?0.83 from experts review were retained, while <0.83 were revised accordingly. Validation amongst healthcare staff showed positive responses. The guideline was then assessed for feasibility, where 110 older patients (mean age= 68.7�6.1 years) were screened by healthcare staff using the newly developed nutrition screening guideline. Four themes emerged from in-depth interviews: 1) Ease of use; 2) Identification and management of malnutrition; 3) Acceptability; and 4) Implementation of nutrition screening. Conclusion: The newly developed and validated nutrition screening guideline is well-accepted and feasible for healthcare staff to screen older patients in health clinic setting for timely malnutrition identification and management. � 2023 UPM Press.

Exercise and nutritional interventions are well-known for their efficacy in managing Type 2 Diabetes, and metformin remains a widely used pharmacological agent. However, metformin may reduce exercise capacity and interfere with skeletal muscle adaptations, creating barriers to exercise adherence. Research into optimising the timing of exercise has shown promise, particularly for glycaemic management in people with Type 2 Diabetes. Aligning exercise timing with circadian rhythms and nutritional intake may maximise benefits. Nutritional timing also plays a crucial role in glycaemic control. Recent research suggests that not only what we eat but when we eat significantly impacts glycaemic control, with strategies like time-restricted feeding (TRF) showing promise in reducing caloric intake, improving glycaemic regulation, and enhancing overall metabolic health. These findings suggest that meal timing could be an important adjunct to traditional dietary and exercise approaches in managing diabetes and related metabolic disorders. When taking a holistic view of Diabetes management and the diurnal environment, one must also consider the circadian biology of medicines. Metformin has a circadian profile in plasma, and our recent study suggests that morning exercise combined with pre-breakfast metformin intake reduces glycaemia more effectively than post-breakfast intake. In this review, we aim to explore the integration of circadian biology into Type 2 Diabetes management by examining the timing of exercise, nutrition, and medication. In conclusion, chrono-medicine offers a promising, cost-effective strategy for managing Type 2 Diabetes. Integrating precision timing of exercise, nutrition, and medication into treatment plans requires considering the entire diurnal environment, including lifestyle and occupational factors, to develop comprehensive, evidence-based healthcare strategies. � 2024 Cambridge University Press.

Currently, childcare teachers provide lunch to most children in Korea. The purpose of this study was to investigate the portion size provided by teachers and examine the effect of education on food serving size. Methods: The subjects were childcare teachers (n = 120) in charge of children aged 3-5 years at a daycare center in Hanam-si. The survey was conducted through questionnaires which included questions on the general characteristics of the teachers, their nutritional education status, and the source of nutrition information. In addition, the portion sizes of items on the menu currently provided to children were measured and the data were analyzed. To assess the effectiveness of education in determining serving size, the subjects were randomly equally divided into two groups. In the first group (n = 60) theoretical education on nutrition and serving sizes was given, whereas in the second (n = 60), practical education on these topics was provided. Results: The difference between the actual portion size of rice and the serving size announced on the menu was observed to decrease along with the increase in the experience of the teacher, although the differences in the main dish and kimchi were higher. The gap between the serving size mentioned in the menu and the portion size distributed widened as the age of the teachers increased. Notably, the difference between the portion size and the serving size of food decreased after both practical and theoretical education. Furthermore, the effect of education on the serving size of the main dishes (p < 0.001), side dishes (p < 0.01), and kimchi (p < 0.01) was observed to be greater in the practical education group than in the theoretical education group. Conclusion: Regular education should be provided to teachers on the serving sizes mentioned in the menu, as the quantity of food served depends on the experience and age of teachers. In the case of rice, theoretical education alone sufficed to ensure a proper serving size. However, hands-on training on the main and side dishes, and kimchi would be much more helpful. � 2022 The Korean Nutrition Society This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/) which permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.","education; food intake; portion size, child care; serving size",article; child; child care; childhood; comparative effectiveness; day care; development; education; educational status; female; food intake; human; human experiment; infant; kimchi; Korea; major clinical study; male; nonhuman; nutrition education; portion size; preschool child; questionnaire; rice; teacher; theoretical study,"W.

While food product labelling is deemed important in providing consumer information, little is known about the characteristics of those reading and not reading. This study aimed to determine the socio-demographic characteristics of Filipino adult consumers reading and not reading food product labels and nutrition facts to provide insights on their understanding and usage of food labels that may help in designing better label formats of packaged foods and related health education campaigns. Methods. Cross-sectional design using secondary data from the Expanded National Nutrition Survey (ENNS) 2018-2019 was employed. A survey form on Reading Food Product Labels and Nutrition Facts in the ENNS 2018-2019 were collected through face-to-face interviews. Descriptive statistics, test of proportions, and logistic regression were done using Stata version 16. Results. Always reading product labels were reported only by 19.6% of adult consumers, 18 years old and above, while 45.9% reported not reading food product labels. Among those who read food product labels, only 16.7% reported reading nutrition facts. Higher proportions of adults reading nutrition facts were found among those who attained a higher educational level, were less than 40 years old, living in urban residences, and belonging to higher wealth status. �Not interested� was the top reason of adults who reported not reading nutrition facts. Conclusion. Reading product labels and nutrition facts is not common among Filipino adults. Being not interested was the top reason for not reading food product labels. Older persons, adults with low educational attainment, and belonging to poor households were more likely to not read food product labels and not influenced by nutrition facts which imply the need for a food label format that would cater to those who cannot or have difficulty reading food labels and nutrition facts. An intensified campaign on the importance of reading food product labels is also needed. � 2024 University of the Philippines Manila.

Outcomes were all-cause mortality and CVD incidence and mortality. There were 1722 mortality cases within 115 566 person-years of follow-up (median (interquartile range) of 7.48 (7.22-7.70) years). There was no statistically significant association between Na density or energy from saturated fat and all-cause mortality or CVD events for all models investigated. The association of usual percentage of energy from added sugars and all-cause mortality was significant in the base model with participants consuming 11.47 % of energy from added sugars having 1 34 (95 % CI 1 01, 1 77) times higher risk of all-cause mortality compared with those consuming 4.17 % of energy from added sugars. Overall, our results did not find statistically significant associations between the three nutrients and risk of all-cause mortality or CVD events at the population level in Canada.

Over the 13 years from 2010 to 2023, there were several undertakings to strengthen the enabling environment for sustainable nutrition-sensitive agriculture (NSA) and food systems in Nigeria. Some studies were also conducted over the period to foster better understanding of the national enabling environment and facilitate effective actions. Objective: This article documents successes and failures from Nigeria�s experiences by reflecting on critical developments, events, policies, and programmes on Nigeria�s journey toward advancing nutrition through agriculture and food systems; as well as findings from conducted studies. Discussion: Successes include the existence of a Nutrition and Food Safety Division in the Ministry of Agriculture and an approval for a Nutrition Department, existence of an agriculture sector nutrition strategy, increased private sector engagement and commitment to nutrition-sensitive food systems, and increased funding for nutrition in the agriculture sector. Challenges especially remain for scaling up strategic, operational, and delivery capacity of both organizations and individuals involved in advancing NSA and food systems. Lessons learned include�institutionalizing NSA and food systems takes time; knowledge brokering is indispensable and requires several collaborating entities and stakeholders; and approaches used should be suited to available government capacity. Conclusion: More than a decade of efforts targeting different enabling environment factors has resulted in greater political commitment for nutrition within the agriculture sector and an improved enabling environment for NSA and food systems. � The Author(s) 2023.; Plain language title: The Ability of Nigeria�s Agriculture Sector and Food Systems to Improve Nutrition Has Increased Following Policy, Advocacy, and Capacity Interventions Plain language summary: Globally, countries are being asked to ensure that their agricultural and food systems promote adequate nutrition and health. There are published recommendations about what countries need to do to ensure such agricultural and food systems, but very little operational guidance about how to implement these recommendations within the context of established, often inert institutions. In the 13 years from 2010 to 2023, Nigeria worked to make recommendations for agricultural and food systems that improve nutrition become the normal practice among relevant institutions and stakeholders. Efforts included policy, advocacy, and capacity-building activities as well as the conduct of research to direct necessary actions. Several successes and failures were encountered in the process. This article documents the successes and failures and summarizes research findings. The goal of the article is to provide lessons to other low- and middle-income countries that would like to develop agricultural and food systems that improve nutrition so that these countries are able to avoid or manage predictable risks. Successes include the establishment of an Office in the Ministry of Agriculture that oversees the incorporation of nutrition considerations into agricultural activities, the development of a strategy to help agricultural stakeholders know what to do to improve nutrition, and increased financing of activities related to the target recommendations. Challenges include difficulties in increasing the knowledge, skills, and motivation of relevant organizations and stakeholders to add new ways of action to their normal routine. There is a need to keep on doing the things that facilitated success and avoid the causes of the challenges. The commitment of the government to implementing the recommendations for agricultural and food systems that improve nutrition remains strong and the government will continue to try different methods to increase required knowledge, skills, and motivation. � The Author(s) 2023.",Africa; capacity; food systems; nutrition; scaling up; success factors,Agriculture; Government; Humans; Nigeria; Nutritional Status; Nigeria; agricultural market; food supply; governance approach; nutrition; private sector; stakeholder; adult; agriculture; article; food safety; funding; government; Nigeria; nutrition; organization; private sector; scale up; human; Nigeria; nutritional status,"O.

Data of cancer survivors were extracted from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys database in 2007-2014 in this cross-sectional study. Weighted multivariable logistic regression models were used to estimate OR and 95 % CI for the association of DAQS and leisure-time physical activity on sleep patterns. The combined association was also assessed in subgroups of participants based on age and use of painkillers and antidepressants. Among the eligible participants, 1133 had unhealthy sleep patterns. After adjusting for covariates, compared with low DAQS level combined with leisure-time physical activity level < 600 MET�min/week, high DAQS level combined with leisure-time physical activity ? 600 MET�min/week was associated with lower odds of unhealthy sleep patterns (OR = 0�41, 95 % CI: 0�23, 0�72). Additionally, the association of high DAQS level combined with high leisure-time physical activity with low odds of unhealthy sleep patterns was also significant in < 65 years old (OR = 0�30, 95 % CI: 0�13, 0�70), non-painkiller (OR = 0�39, 95 % CI: 0�22, 0�71), non-antidepressant (OR = 0�49, 95 % CI: 0�26, 0�91) and antidepressant (OR = 0�11, 95 % CI: 0�02, 0�50) subgroups.

Finding cost-effective prevention and treatment strategies for sarcopenia for the growing ageing population is therefore of great public health interest. Although nutrition is considered an important factor in the aetiology of sarcopenia, its potential for sarcopenia prevention and/or treatment is still being evaluated. Nutrition research for sarcopenia utilises three main approaches to understand muscle-nutrition relationships, evaluating: single nutrients, whole foods, and whole diet effects�both alone or combined with exercise. Applying these approaches, we summarise recent evidence from qualitative and quantitative syntheses of findings from observational and intervention studies of healthy older adults, and those with sarcopenia. We consider protein supplements, whole foods (fruits and vegetables), and the Mediterranean diet as exemplars. There is some evidence of beneficial effects of protein supplementation ?0.8g/kg body weight/day on muscle mass when combined with exercise training in intervention studies of healthy and sarcopenic older adults. In contrast, evidence for effects on muscle function (strength and physical performance) is inconclusive. There is reasonably consistent epidemiological evidence suggesting benefits of higher fruits and vegetables consumption for better physical performance. Similarly, higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet is associated with beneficial effects on muscle function in observational studies. However, intervention studies are lacking. This review discusses how current evidence may inform the development of preventive and intervention strategies for optimal muscle ageing and nutritional public policy aimed at combatting sarcopenia. � 2024 Cambridge University Press.

It draws on research on the political economy of food, and the governance effects of food aid practices, conducted in Sudan and Somalia and on the role of a social approach to nutrition in situations of famine and mass starvation. This article argues first for the importance of examining political structures as basic causes of malnutrition as they influence whether and how institutions function (in relation to land, markets, employment, aid, or justice). Second, this article illustrates how, in situations of crisis, the manipulation of institutions can create power for some and vulnerability to malnutrition in others. Third, it argues that a focus on treatment of malnutrition and behavior (hygiene and feeding practices) has drawn attention away from systems and institutions and feeds into discrimination as a basic cause. � The Author(s) 2023.",food security; governance; humanitarian crisis; institutions; nutrition; political economy,Food Security; Food Supply; Humans; Malnutrition; Nutritional Status; Starvation; Somalia; Sudan; crisis management; food safety; governance approach; humanitarian aid; institutional framework; livelihood; nutrition; political economy; catering service; food security; human; malnutrition; nutritional status; starvation,"S.

We aimed to derive and characterise temporal EI and PA patterns, and assess their cross-sectional association with weight status, in 6-to-14-year-old Portuguese participants of the National Food, Nutrition and Physical Activity Survey 2015-2016. We extracted times and EI of all eating occasions from two 1-d food diaries/24-h recalls, while types and times of PA from 4-d PA diaries. We derived EI patterns (n 714) and PA patterns (n 595), using, respectively, a hierarchical and K-means cluster analysis, considering the average proportion of total daily EI (%TEI) and PA intensity (%TPA), within each 2-h interval across the 24-h day. Patterns were labelled based on the 2-h intervals of %TEI/TPA peaks. We assessed the association between patterns and overweight or obesity (BMI z-score ? +1 sd) using adjusted logistic regressions (OR (95 % CI)). Three EI patterns emerged: 1 - 'Early afternoon and early evening'; 2 - 'Early afternoon and late evening'; and 3 - 'Late morning, early and mid-afternoon and late evening'. EI Pattern 3 v. Pattern 1 was negatively associated with overweight or obesity (0.49 (0.26, 0.92)). PA Pattern 1 - 'Late morning, mid-afternoon and early evening' v. Pattern 2 - 'Late afternoon', was not associated with weight status (0.95 (0.65, 1.38)). A daily EI pattern with more and even %TEI peaks at earlier daytime periods, rather than fewer and higher, may be negatively associated with overweight or obesity amongst this population whereas the identified PA patterns might have no relationship. � The Author(s), 2024.

Design: Analysis of prospectively collected WIC administrative data. The outcome was obesity at age 4 years (BMI-for-age ? 95th percentile). Poisson regression was applied to a matched sample (n 79 502) to determine if the association between the WIC food package change and child obesity was modified by family income (<50 % federal poverty level (FPL), 50-100 % FPL, >100 % but <185 % FPL) and neighbourhood poverty. Setting: Los Angeles County, California. Participants: Children who participated in WIC in Los Angeles County between 2003 and 2016; children were grouped as receiving the old WIC food package (2003-2009) or the new WIC food package (2010-2016). Results: Receiving the new WIC food package (i.e., post-2009) was associated with 7-18 % lower obesity risk across all family income categories. Neither family income nor neighbourhood poverty significantly modified the association between the WIC food package and child obesity. However, certain sub-groups seemed to benefit more from the food package change than others. In particular, boys from families with income above poverty but residing in the poorest neighbourhoods experienced the greatest reductions in obesity risk (relative risk = 0�77; 95 % CI 0�66, 0�88). Conclusions: The WIC food package revisions were associated with reduced childhood obesity risk among all WIC-participating families in Los Angeles County, across levels of income eligibility and neighbourhood poverty. � 2021 Cambridge University Press.

However, the response to dietary interventions varies widely, highlighting the need for refinement and personalisation beyond population-based �one size fits all�. This article reviews the clinical evidence supporting precision nutrition as a fundamental approach for dietary advice in diabetes. Further, it proposes a framework for the eventual implementation of precision nutrition and discusses key challenges for the application of this approach in the prevention of diabetes. One implication of this approach is that precision nutrition would not exclude the parallel goal of population-based healthy dietary advice. Nevertheless, the shift in prioritising precision nutrition is needed to reflect the dynamic nature of responses to dietary interventions that vary among individuals and change over the life course.

Design: We performed a cross-sectional analysis using data from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Dietary intake information was assessed using first 24-h dietary recall interviews, and the Kidney Conditions were presented by a questionnaire. The primary outcome was to investigate the association between DII and incidence of kidney stones, and the secondary outcome was to assess the association between DII and nephrolithiasis recurrence. Setting: The NHANES, 2007-2016. Participants: The study included 25 984 NHANES participants, whose data on DII and kidney stones were available, of whom 2439 reported a history of kidney stones. Results: For the primary outcome, after fully multivariate adjustment, DII score is positively associated with the risk of kidney stones (OR = 1�07; 95 % CI 1�04, 1�10). Then, compared Q4 with Q1, a significant 38 % increased likelihood of nephrolithiasis was observed. (OR = 1�38; 95 % CI 1�19, 1�60). For the secondary outcome, the multivariate regression analysis showed that DII score is positively correlated with nephrolithiasis recurrence (OR = 1�07; 95 % CI 1�00, 1�15). The results noted that higher DII scores (Q3 and Q4) are positively associated with a significant 48 % and 61 % increased risk of nephrolithiasis recurrence compared with the reference after fully multivariate adjustment (OR = 1�48; 95 % CI 1�07, 2�05; OR = 1�61; 95 % CI 1�12, 2�31). Conclusions: Our findings revealed that increased intake of pro-inflammatory diet, as a higher DII score, is correlated with increased odds of kidney stones incidence and recurrence.  � The Author(s) 2021.",Dietary Inflammatory Index; Kidney stones; National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey; Pro-Inflammatory diet,Adult; Cross-Sectional Studies; Diet; Humans; Inflammation; Kidney Calculi; Nutrition Surveys; Risk Factors; adult; adverse event; cross-sectional study; diet; human; inflammation; nephrolithiasis; nutrition; risk factor,"Q.

The studies were recent, most of them published after 2015, being produced in Global North countries. The most often used study design was cross-sectional; the least frequently used study design was ethnographic. Body image and weight control were predominant themes (n 25), followed by food and nutrition security (n 5), nutritional status (n 5), nutritional health assistance (n 1) and emic visions of healthy eating (n 1). Conclusions: The transgender community presents body, food and nutritional relationships traversed by its unique gender experience, which challenges dietary and nutritional recommendations based on the traditional division by sex (male and female).

A multi-disciplinary working and a reading group were involved. The procedure was divided into four phases: (1) systematic review and synthesis of the literature; (2) writing of the initial version of the guidelines; (3) reading and (4) finalisation. The literature search included international guidelines, meta-analyses, systematic reviews and randomised control trials from January 2007 to 31 July 2018. A two-step approach was selected: diagnosing undernutrition and then grading its severity. For diagnosis at least one phenotypic criterion associated with at least one aetiologic criterion were required for both children and adults. Phenotypic criteria for children were weight loss, Body Mass Index (BMI) < International Obesity Task Force curve 18�5, weight stagnation, reduction of muscle mass/function; for adults: weight loss, BMI < 18�5 and reduction of muscle mass/function. Aetiological criteria for children and adults were reduction in dietary intake, reduced absorption and hypercatabolism. Phenotypic metrics were used in both children and adults for grading severity (moderate or severe). These new French recommendations integrate the proposals of recent international recommendations combining aetiologic with phenotypic criteria, but for the first time, they are concordant for children and adults. The WHO threshold of 18�5 for BMI was kept as phenotypic criteria because epidemiological data show an increased mortality for that threshold. � The Author(s), 2021.

Chan School of Public Health, Boston, United States","Abstract Objective: We assessed the ability of the Prime Diet Quality Score (PDQS) to predict mortality in the US population and compared its predictiveness with that of the Healthy Eating Index-2015 (HEI-2015). Design: PDQS and HEI-2015 scores were derived using two 24-h recalls and converted to quintiles. Mortality data were obtained from the 2015 Public-Use Linked Mortality File. Associations between diet quality and all-cause mortality were evaluated using multivariable Cox proportional hazards models, and predictive performance of the two metrics was compared using a Wald test of equality of coefficients with both scores in a single model. Finally, we evaluated associations between individual metric components and mortality. Setting: A prospective analysis of the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data. Participants: Five-thousand five hundred and twenty-five participants from three survey cycles (2003-2008) in the NHANES aged 40 years and over. Results: Over the 51 248 person-years of follow-up (mean: 9�2 years), 767 deaths were recorded. In multivariable models, hazard ratios between the highest and lowest quintiles of diet quality scores were 0�70 (95 % CI 0�51, 0�96, Ptrend = 0�03) for the PDQS and 0�77 (95 % CI 0�57, 1�03, Ptrend = 0�20) for the HEI-2015. The PDQS and HEI-2015 were similarly good predictors of total mortality (Pdifference = 0�88). Conclusion: Among US adults, better diet quality measured by the PDQS was associated with reduced risk of all-cause mortality. Given that the PDQS is simpler to calculate than the HEI-2015, it should be evaluated further for use as a diet quality metric globally.  � ",All-cause mortality; Diet quality metrics; Healthy Eating Index-2015; NHANES; Prime Diet Quality Score,Adult; Diet; Humans; Mental Recall; Middle Aged; Nutrition Surveys; adult; all cause mortality; article; controlled study; eating; female; follow up; human; major clinical study; male; nutrition; prospective study; public health; recall; United States; diet; middle aged; nutrition; recall,"S.

(Rosaceae) is one of the three unstudied Rubus species that grow in Ethiopia. The present work was aimed to determine the physicochemical characteristics, micronutrients, anthocyanins, and antinutrients of ripe and unripe R. steudneri fruits using a range of analytical protocols. The present work also investigated the ?-glucosidase inhibitory activity of ripe and unripe fruits. The total and acid-insoluble ash contents of ripe fruits were higher than those of unripe fruits. Changes in the micronutrient contents and antinutrients were also observed during ripening. Ripe fruits contained anthocyanins, mineral elements, and water-soluble vitamins, namely niacin and pyridoxine, in higher quantities than in unripe fruits. Toxic heavy metals were not detected in both ripe and unripe fruits. There were lower amounts of tannin and phytic acid in ripe fruits than in unripe fruits. Both ripe and unripe fruit extracts displayed inhibitory activity against ?-glucosidase. Greater inhibitory activity was shown by ripe fruits than unripe fruits, as indicated by the IC50 values. The total phenolics and flavonoids were slightly higher in unripe fruits. The lower contents of antinutrients (tannin and phytic acid), and the absence of toxic heavy metals indicate the edibility of R. steudneri fruits. The ripe and unripe fruits can also be used to manage diabetes mellitus as the extracts displayed inhibitory potential against ?-glucosidase. The observed inhibitory activity could be ascribed to the phenolics and flavonoids of the fruits � 2022,International Food Research Journal.All Rights Reserved",Anthocyanins; Diabetes mellitus; Flavonoid; Phytic acid; Rubus steudneri; Tannin,,"H.L.

Design: Cross-sectional telephone-based survey Setting: Italy, 2010-2013. Participants: In total, 9078 participants (5-97 years) from the Italian Nutrition & Health Survey. Dietary intakes were collected by a 1-d 24-h dietary recall. UPF was defined by the NOVA classification and expressed as percentage of total energies. Results: Average energy intake from UPF (95 % CI) was 17�3 % (17�1 %, 17�6 %) among adults and 25�9 % (24�8 %, 27�0 %) in children/adolescents. Top sources of UPF were processed meats (32�5 %) and bread substitutes (16�7 %).

Boys consumed two-point percent more UPF of the total energy than girls (? = 2�01; 95 % CI (0�20, 3�82)). For all ages, a Mediterranean diet was inversely associated with UPF (? = -4�86; 95 % CI (-5�53, -4�20) for good v. poor adherence in adults and (? = -5�08; 95 % CI (-8�38, -1�77) for kids). Conclusions: UPF contributes a modest proportion of energy to the diets of Italian adults while being one-quarter of the total energies in children/adolescents. UPF was associated with several psychosocial factors and eating behaviours. Increased adherence to Mediterranean diet would possibly result in lower UPF consumption.  � The Author(s) 2021.",General population; Psychosocial factors; Socio-economic factors; Ultra-processed food,"Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Child; Cohort Studies; Cross-Sectional Studies; Diet; Diet, Mediterranean; Fast Foods; Female; Food Handling; Health Surveys; Humans; Male; adolescent; adult; aged; child; cohort analysis; cross-sectional study; diet; fast food; female; food handling; health survey; human; male; Mediterranean diet","L.

In Brazil, access to adequate food is a fundamental human right guaranteed under the country�s Constitution since 2010. As such, the State assumes the distinct and complementary obligations to respect, protect, promote and provide the Right to Adequate Food. The aim of this study is to present actions related to the �provision� dimension that have been developed as part of a network of public infrastructure strategies for food and nutrition security in Brazil. Through an exploratory, analytical literature review, the paper focuses on the operational designs and logistics of three main strategies: Food Banks, Community Kitchens, and Popular Restaurants. The Brazilian experience indicates that public actions are necessary, especially considering the urgency for those groups living with hunger and poverty. While similar programs can be found in other countries in South and North America, they are mostly offered by civil society organizations, and have not advanced toward public institutionalization. In fact, private programs are criticized for negating governments� obligation and responsibility in this area. Brazil�s experience sheds light on public initiatives in meeting the State�s obligations towards the Right to Adequate Food. � 2022, International Society for Plant Pathology and Springer Nature B.V.",Community kitchens; Food and nutrition security; Food assistance; Food banks; Human rights; Nutrition and food programs and policies; Popular restaurant; Public policy,Brazil; North America; civil society; food policy; food security; human rights; hunger; infrastructure; nutrition; social policy,"A.

Methods: Study subjects were selected (n = 5,103) from the participants of the 7th Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2018 and divided into depression (men, 59; women, 162) and normal groups (men, 2,083; women, 2,799). Subjects with a Patient Health Questionnaire 9 score ? 10 (out of 27 points) were defined as having depression. Results: A higher prevalence of depression was observed in both men and women who were unemployed (p < 0.001, p = 0.008), had lower income (both p < 0.001), poorer subjective health (both p < 0.001), and poor food safety (both p < 0.001). The prevalence of depression was higher in women with lower education levels (p = 0.008), who were unmarried (p = 0.010), smokers (p < 0.001), and in a one-person household (p = 0.001). Obese men showed a higher prevalence of depression (p = 0.009). Men who were eating alone or skipping lunch had a high prevalence of depression (p = 0.009), while women who were eating breakfast (p = 0.012), lunch (p = 0.001), and dinner (p = 0.010) alone had a high prevalence of depression. The relationship analysis between men and women according to dietary habits using logistic regression showed that, in women, after variable adjustment, skipping lunch (odds ratio [OR], 2.677; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.090�6.574), meal frequency of 2 times per day (OR, 1.658; 95% CI, 1.084�2.536), and lunch frequency of 3�4 times per week (OR, 3.143; 95% CI, 1.725�5.728) were significantly associated with a higher prevalence of depression. Conclusion: Depression in women was not only affected by more sociodemographic variables but also associated with decreased frequency of lunch and dinner, especially with skipping lunch. � 2021 Korean Nutrition Society.

Design: We used annual longitudinal data (four time points) from a cluster-randomised effectiveness trial of a participatory nutrition-sensitive agroecology intervention, the Singida Nutrition and Agroecology Project. Structural equation modelling estimation of total, natural direct and natural indirect effects was used to investigate food security's role in the intervention's impact on women's risk of probable depression (Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale > 17) across 3 years. Setting: Rural Singida, Tanzania. Participants: 548 food insecure, married, smallholder women farmers with children < 1 year old at baseline. Results: At baseline, one-third of the women in each group had probable depression (Control: 32�0 %, Intervention: 31�9 %, P difference = 0�97). The intervention lowered the odds of probable depression by 43 % (OR = 0�57, 95 % CI: 0�43, 0�70). Differences in food insecurity explained approximately 10 percentage points of the effects of the intervention on odds of probable depression (OR = 0�90, 95 % CI: 0�83, 0�95). Conclusions: This is the first evidence of the strong, positive effect that lowering food insecurity has on reducing women's depressive symptoms. Nutrition-sensitive agricultural interventions can have broader impacts than previously demonstrated, i.e. improvements in mental health; changes in food security play an important causal role in this pathway. As such, these data suggest participatory nutrition-sensitive agroecology interventions have the potential to be an accessible method of improving women's well-being in farming communities. � The Author(s), 2021.

We quantified US levels of CVH using the new score. Methods: We included individuals ages 2 through 79 years (not pregnant or institutionalized) who were free of cardiovascular disease from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys in 2013 through 2018. For all participants, we calculated the overall CVH score (range, 0 [lowest] to 100 [highest]), as well as the score for each component of diet, physical activity, nicotine exposure, sleep duration, body mass index, blood lipids, blood glucose, and blood pressure, using published American Heart Association definitions. Sample weights and design were incorporated in calculating prevalence estimates and standard errors using standard survey procedures. CVH scores were assessed across strata of age, sex, race and ethnicity, family income, and depression. Results: There were 23 409 participants, representing 201 728 000 adults and 74 435 000 children. The overall mean CVH score was 64.7 (95% CI, 63.9-65.6) among adults using all 8 metrics and 65.5 (95% CI, 64.4-66.6) for the 3 metrics available (diet, physical activity, and body mass index) among children and adolescents ages 2 through 19 years. For adults, there were significant differences in mean overall CVH scores by sex (women, 67.0; men, 62.5), age (range of mean values, 62.2-68.7), and racial and ethnic group (range, 59.7-68.5). Mean scores were lowest for diet, physical activity, and body mass index metrics. There were large differences in mean scores across demographic groups for diet (range, 23.8-47.7), nicotine exposure (range, 63.1-85.0), blood glucose (range, 65.7-88.1), and blood pressure (range, 49.5-84.0). In children, diet scores were low (mean 40.6) and were progressively lower in higher age groups (from 61.1 at ages 2 through 5 to 28.5 at ages 12 through 19); large differences were also noted in mean physical activity (range, 63.1-88.3) and body mass index (range, 74.4-89.4) scores by sociodemographic group. Conclusions: The new Life's Essential 8 score helps identify large group and individual differences in CVH. Overall CVH in the US population remains well below optimal levels and there are both broad and targeted opportunities to monitor, preserve, and improve CVH across the life course in individuals and the population. � 2022 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Introduction: General practitioners are usually the first contacts in the health care system for patients with diet-related chronic conditions. While there is some evidence that general practitioners can be effective in delivering nutrition care for a number of outcomes, to inform future care, an update of the evidence is required as well as an examination of which components are associated with positive outcomes. Inclusion criteria: Published studies will be included if they report on adults with or at risk of diet-related chronic conditions; one-on-one nutrition care interventions individually delivered by general practitioners during primary care consultations; usual or no care as comparators; dietary and/or health outcomes with a minimum three-month follow-up; and randomized controlled trials. Included studies will be available in, or able to be translated into, English and will have no date restrictions. Methods: The databases to be searched will include CINAHL, Embase, MEDLINE, and ProQuest Nursing and Allied Health. Following deduplication, two reviewers will independently screen the titles and abstracts in Covidence, followed by the full texts of potentially relevant studies.

PURPOSE: Relatively little attention has been paid to the possible role of nutrition inmyopia. The availability of the large National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data set, which includes results from vision examinations, offers the opportunity to investigate the relationship between several nutrition-related factors, including body metrics, and the presence and magnitude of myopia. METHODS: Cross-sectional survey data sets with vision examination, demographic, body metrics, and nutritional data, collected as part of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey over the years of 2003 to 2008, were extracted for analysis. Based on already published basic and epidemiological studies, the following parameters were selected for study: body height and body mass index, demographics, serum vitamin D and glucose/insulin levels, and caffeine intake, usingmultivariable models and objectivelymeasured refractive errors as themain outcomemeasure. RESULTS: Data from a total of 6855 ethnically diverse Americans aged 12 to 25 years were analyzed. In final multivariate models, female sex and age were themost significant factors related to myopia status and refractive error. In general, bodymetrics (bodymass index) or nutritional factors (serum vitamin D, glucose levels, and caffeine intake) were found to be associated with refractive error or myopia status; however, increased insulin levels were related to increased odds of having myopia. CONCLUSIONS: These largely negative findings suggest that other environmental factors, such as those related to the visual environment,may contributemore to the development and/or progression of myopia and would argue for continued research in these areas in support of more evidence-based myopia clinical management.

Moreover, adults with diabetes are at a high risk of influenza-mediated morbidity and mortality. Purpose�of the study: With the increasing prevalence of diabetes, influenza is more lethal in diabetics; thus, we aimed to investigate the factors associated with influenza vaccination coverage in patients with diabetes. Methods: Cross-sectional data were obtained from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2016�2018). We retrospectively analyzed whether sociodemographic, health-related, and medical factors are associated with influenza vaccination coverage in patients with diabetes. We performed a complex sample logistic regression analysis and estimated the odds ratios (ORs) by adjusting for statistically significant factors. Results: The number of survey subjects was 18,553. The vaccine coverage rate among patients with diabetes was 60.6%. In the univariate analysis, sex, educational level, smoking, exercise, drinking, marital status, private health insurance, activity limit, economic activity, age, and EuroQol-5 Dimension scores, which were used to assess health-related quality of life, were associated with vaccination coverage. In the multivariate analysis, only age and economic activity were associated with vaccination coverage. The vaccination coverage rate was higher for people who did not undertake economic activities and who were older (OR 1.512 (1.087�2.105), OR 2.212 (1.822�2.686), respectively, p < 0.001). Conclusion: National interventions involving public health centers are necessary to encourage influenza immunization for patients with diabetes, especially younger patients and those who work or undertake economic activities. � 2021, Research Society for Study of Diabetes in India.",Diabetes; Influenza vaccination coverage; South Korea,influenza vaccine; adult; age; Article; clinical assessment; controlled study; cross-sectional study; diabetes mellitus; disease association; drinking behavior; economic aspect; educational status; environmental factor; European Quality of Life 5 Dimensions questionnaire; exercise; female; health behavior; human; influenza; influenza vaccination; logistic regression analysis; major clinical study; male; marriage; medical examination; multivariate analysis; physical activity; prevalence; private health insurance; quality of life; retrospective study; smoking; social status; sociodemographics; South Korea; univariate analysis; vaccination coverage,"A.L.

This paper investigates the effectiveness of leveraging food related text corpora (e.g., food and agricultural literature) in pretraining transformer-based language models. We evaluate our trained language model, called AgriBERT, on the task of semantic matching, i.e., establishing mapping between food descriptions and nutrition data, which is a long-standing challenge in the agricultural domain. In particular, we formulate the task as an answer selection problem, fine-tune the trained language model with the help of an external source of knowledge (e.g., FoodOn ontology), and establish a baseline for this task. The experimental results reveal that our language model substantially outperforms other language models and baselines in the task of matching food description and nutrition. � 2022 International Joint Conferences on Artificial Intelligence.

Advances in mobile and wearable sensors, combined with new image based methods, particularly deep learning based approaches, have shown great promise to improve the accuracy of food classification to assess dietary intake. However, these approaches are data-hungry and their performances are heavily reliant on the quantity and quality of the available datasets for training the food classification model. Existing food image datasets are not suitable for fine-grained food classification and the following nutrition analysis as they lack fine-grained and transparently derived food group based identification which are often provided by trained dietitians with expert domain knowledge. In this paper, we propose a framework to create a nutrition and food group based image database that contains both visual and hierarchical food categorization information to enhance links to the nutrient profile of each food. We design a protocol for linking food group based food codes in the U.S. Department of Agriculture�s (USDA) Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies (FNDDS) to a food image dataset, and implement a web-based annotation tool for efficient deployment of this protocol. Our proposed method is used to build a nutrition and food group based image database including 16,114 food images representing the 74 most frequently consumed What We Eat in America (WWEIA) food sub-categories in the United States with 1,865 USDA food code matched to a nutrient database, the USDA FNDDS nutrient database. � 2022, Society for Imaging Science and Technology.",,Agriculture; Classification (of information); Codes (symbols); Database systems; Deep learning; Image enhancement; Nutrients; Dietary assessments; Dietary intakes; Fine grained; Food image; Group-based; Image database; Image datasets; Image-based methods; Learning-based approach; Performance; Nutrition,,,Society for Imaging Science and Technology,24701173,,,,English,IS T Intl.

In the present study dietary index of the players who are studying in tribal schools of Chhattisgarh and players who are residing in urban area and training under Sports Authority of India was assessed. Total of 200 subjects aged between 14 to 17 years participated in this study. Descriptive statistics and ANOVA were used to compare the nutritional status of different groups. The result of the study revealed that DNI of tribal boys and girls and SAI girls is inadequate. Further it was found that there was a significant difference between the groups. SAI boys and girls showed better values as compared to tribal boys and girls. It is suggested that intervention to meet the dietary requirement of the players should be planned for optimal performance. � 2021 The Author(s).",Dietary nutrition index (DNI); Home diet; Sports authority of india (SAI); Tribal school of kanker (TSP),,"R.

Recent Findings: This population is at-risk for experiencing food and nutrition insecurity due to high rates of unemployment, parental history of incarceration, housing instability, depressive symptoms, and social isolation, which result from involvement with the corrections system. Health consequences associated with food insecurity include depressive symptoms, self-reporting lower health status, and engaging in HIV-risk behaviors. Summary: The justice-impacted population has a disproportionately higher risk of chronic and infectious diseases compared to the general population. Compounding this with food and nutrition insecurity can exacerbate these outcomes and further contribute to poor health. Structural issues related to nutrition safety net programs and employment create barriers to healthy food access. More research related to food, employment, and corrections system policies are critical to improve the well-being of this population. � 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Criminal justice; Food access; Food insecurity; Nutrition insecurity; Prison; Probation,Food Insecurity; Food Supply; Health Status; Humans; Nutritional Status; Social Justice; cocaine; diamorphine; alcohol consumption; cardiovascular disease; chronic infection; consumption-based indicator; criminal justice; depression; dietary intake; drug dependence; drug misuse; economic instability; food access; food insecurity; health care cost; health care policy; health status; hepatitis C; Hepatitis C virus; housing instability; human; Human immunodeficiency virus; incarceration; mental health; nutrition; population risk; prevalence; public health; racial disparity; Review; risk behavior; risk factor; social inequality; social isolation; social support; catering service; food insecurity; nutritional status; social justice,"K.R.

With advocacy and awareness, even farmers with small and marginal land holdings can be persuaded to divert small pieces of land from traditional crops, to MN-dense crops like vegetables, fruits, pulses, and millets. Backyard poultry with high egg-yielding birds is a good option to promote, since eggs are highly nutritious. To ensure that this farm produce is primarily consumed at home and only excess sold, there has to be a robust strategy of behavioural change communication. Educational intervention/technology transfer can be through a combination of centralised training programmes, hands-on training in farms, as well as through distribution of simple educational pamphlets. Since nutrition security goes beyond food security and includes safe environment, drinking water, and health care, the educational package should be a holistic one. Pregnant women and mothers with under 24-month-old children (the first 1000�days after conception) are the most effective group to target. Recent studies including the one reported here in a tribal community show that such a strategy can help crop diversification, as well as marked improvement in the mothers� understanding of health, food, and nutrition. Significant improvement in household vegetable consumption can also be achieved. � 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to The National Academy of Sciences, India.",Crops; Deficiencies; Malnutrition; Micronutrient,,"M.S.

Changing how foods are presented through digital nudges might help, but these are usually examined in non-personalized contexts, such as a brick-and-mortar supermarket. This study seeks to support healthy food choices in a personalized interface by adding front-of-package nutrition labels to recipes in a food recommender system. After performing an offline evaluation, we conducted an online study (N = 600) with six different recommender interfaces, based on a 2 (non-personalized vs. personalized recipe advice) x 3 (No Label, Multiple Traffic Light, Nutri-Score) between-subjects design.

Design: Data from the Latin American Study of Nutrition and Health (ELANS). Setting: ELANS is a cross-sectional study representative of eight Latin American countries: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Peru and Venezuela. Participants: Two 24-h dietary recalls on non-consecutive days were used to estimate usual dietary intake of 9218 participants with ages between 15-65 years. 'What We Eat in America' food classification system developed by United States Department of Agriculture was adapted and used to classify all food items consumed by the ELANS population. Food sources of energy, added sugars, SFA, Na and total gram amount consumed were identified and ranked based on percentage of contribution to intake of total amount. Results: Three-highest ranked food categories of total energy consumed were: rice (10�3%), yeast breads (6�9%), and turnovers and other grain-based items (6�8 %). Highest ranked food sources of total gram amount consumed were fruit drinks (9�6%), other 100% juice (9�3%) and rice (8�3%). Three highest ranked sources for added sugars were other 100% juice (24�1 %), fruit drinks (16�5%), and sugar and honey (12�4%). SFA ranked foods were turnovers and other grain-based (12�6 %), cheese (11�9%), and pizza (10�3%). Three top sources of Na were rice (13�9%), soups (9�1 %) and rice mixed dishes (7�3 %).

Simultaneously, Martinique has faced a demographic transition marked by significant population ageing. We aimed to differentiate the contribution of changes in health status and dietary intakes due to shifts in demographic and socio-economic characteristics (DSEC) from that due to unobserved factors. Design: Two cross-sectional surveys conducted in 2003 (n 743) and 2013 (n 573) on representative samples were used. Dietary intakes were estimated by 24-h recalls. The contribution of changes in health status and dietary intakes due to shifts in observed DSEC was differentiated from that due to unobserved factors over a 10-year interval, using Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition models. Setting: Martinique, French region in the Caribbean. Participants: Martinican adults (?16 years). Results: Over the study period, health status deteriorated, partly owing to shifts in DSEC, explaining 62 % of the change in the prevalence of hypertension (+13 percentage points (pp)) and 48 % of waist circumference change (+3 cm). Diet quality decreased (mean adequacy ratio -2pp and mean excess ratio + 2 pp) and energy supplied by ultra-processed food increased (+4 pp). Shifts in DSEC marginally explained some changes in dietary intakes (e.g. increased diet quality), while the changes that remained unexplained were of opposite sign, with decreased diet quality, lower fruits, tubers and fish intakes and higher energy provided by ultra-processed foods. Conclusion: Explained dietary changes were of opposite sign to nutrition transition conceptual framework, probably because unobserved drivers are in play, such as food price trends or supermarkets spread.  � The Author(s) 2021.",Caribbean; Dietary changes; French West Indies; Nutrition transition; Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition,,"Z.

Of particular concern are undernutrition from underweight and iron deficiency, along with overweight and obesity, all of which have negative health consequences for mothers and children. Accumulating evidence suggests that risk for poor nutritional outcomes may be mitigated by social support, yet how social support is measured varies tremendously and its effects likely vary by age, kinship and reproductive status. We examine the effects of different measures of social support on weight and iron nutrition among 677 randomly sampled women from rural Bangladesh. While we find that total support network size mitigates risk for underweight, other results point to a potential tradeoff in the effects of kin proximity, with nearby adult children associated with both lower risk for underweight and obesity and higher risk for iron deficiency and anaemia. Social support from kin may then enhance energy balance but not diet quality. Results also suggest that a woman's network of caregivers might reflect their greater need for help, as those who received more help with childcare and housework had worse iron nutrition. Overall, although some findings support the hypothesis that social support can be protective, others emphasize that social relationships often have neutral or negative effects, illustrating the kinds of tradeoffs expected from an evolutionary perspective. The complexities of these effects deserve attention in future work, particularly within public health, where what is defined as 'social support' is often assumed to be positive.

Its lethal and unsafe levels in drinking water have been witnessed by more than 100 million people in the South and South-east Asia alone. Literatures suggest that contaminated groundwater is the potential source for arsenicosis. Widespread arsenic contamination in surface water, soil and sediments-either of geogenic or anthropogenic origin-has resulted in presence of this carcinogenic pollutant in plant and animal produce such as rice, vegetables, milk, meat, fish, etc. Further, the arsenic mediated stress to all living organisms is of great concern. Thus, the entire biome is under massive threat of arsenic. The extent and severity of arsenic contamination in human diet has challenged the safety aspect of human nutrition and health. The chronic arsenicism in human is of greater concern and demands immediate implementation of mitigative measures. The risk of arsenic toxicity through water as well as food and possible way-out have been discussed in this review. � Triveni Enterprises, Lucknow (India)",Arsenic; Food chain; Health; Human diet; Nutrition,South Asia; Southeast Asia; arsenic; food chain; food safety; nutritional requirement; public health; toxicity; water pollution,"S.

The aim of this study is to evaluate near infrared spectroscopy (NIR) for the verification of nutrition declaration on food labels of selected Polish deli products. The accurate declaration of nutritional information is very important for food manufacturers due to legal requirements and for maintaining the image of a trustworthy business. Laboratory analysis is the golden standard, but it is also time consuming and requires infrastructure to run the processing of the samples safely. The alternative solution, NIR, is a rapid, cost-effective, and safe analytical technique which is already used in food industry, however, so far, there is no information on the performance of this method in relation to the verification of nutritional declarations on the labels of processed foods. Materials and methods. In this work, the performance of previously developed NIR calibrations for three groups of Polish deli foods, containing meat (DM), cheese (DC), and pasta (DP), is evaluated. In each product group, between 29 and 50 products have been analysed. Samples were analysed simultaneously using NIR as well as traditional laboratory techniques. Then the differences of the measurements between the NIR prediction and the analytical results were compared with the label declaration tolerance levels set by the European Commission. Results. The developed NIR calibrations allow the fibre and carbohydrate contents to be predicted in compliance with tolerance levels in all three product groups for 100% of the analysed samples. Any remaining nutrients which need to be declared on the label are predicted correctly in 100% of the samples within at least one group of analysed Polish deli foods. The only exception is the content of saturates which is predicted correctly in 83�97% of the samples. These results indicate that NIR could aid food manufacturers in reducing the number of non-compliant nutrition declarations by 9 to 27%. Conclusions. The NIR method is a rapid solution that can effectively support food manufacturers in reducing the number of incorrectly labelled food products, controlling compliance with the recipe, and demonstrating due diligence to ensure that the information about the nutritional value of the purchased food is appropriate. Further research should focus on including a wider variety of products into calibration sets to ensure even better performance of NIR for prediction of the nutritional value of processed foods. � Copyright by Wydawnictwo Uniwersytetu Przyrodniczego w Poznaniu",Accuracy; Deli products; Food label information compliance; In-situ food analysis; Near infrared spectroscopy; Nutrition value,Compliance control; Food processing; Infrared devices; Manufacture; Near infrared spectroscopy; Nutrition; Processed foods; Regulatory compliance; Spectrum analysis; Accuracy; Deli product; Food analysis; Food label information compliance; Food manufacturers; In-situ food analyse; Label information; Nutrition value; Performance; Product groups; Cost effectiveness,"A.

This study aimed to determine the acceptability of four height/length boards as measuring equipment, (1) NNC wooden height board (HB), (2) Allen�s stick, (3) aluminum-acrylic height board, and (4) stadiometer, from the perspective of the community nutrition and health workers (CNHWs) and mothers/caregivers. Methods. The study was conducted in two municipalities in the province of Laguna, Philippines. Respondents were 12 CNHWs and 22 parents/guardians of randomly selected children ages 1-5 years. Focus group discussions were also conducted among CNHWs to determine their perceptions, experiences, and feedback on the use of the equipment. Parents/guardians were interviewed about their views on the acceptability of the equipment. Results and Conclusion. In the urban area, Allen�s stick was most favored by end-users, while in the rural area, the NNC wooden HB was the most acceptable. Meanwhile, guardians preferred the aluminum-acrylic HB in the rural area and Allen�s stick in the urban area. It was concluded that the use of height boards to measure the height or length of children was acceptable to both CHNWs and parents. CHNWs preferred the stadiometer for height measurement and Allen�s stick for length measurement. In contrast parents/guardians preferred the aluminum-acrylic HB and Allen�s stick as these were deemed non-threatening, culturally acceptable, safe, comfortable for the children, and the procedures were easily understood. � 2022 University of the Philippines Manila.

Methods: A scoping review was conducted electronically using SCOPUS, PubMed, ProQuest Health & Medical Complete, and Cochrane databases. The systematic search was performed up to 31st December 2021. Search terms were created for identification of eligible and related articles. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were determined for the systematic search. The search was limited to English and Malay languages, and full text articles with no limitation of years. All data were extracted and analysed, guided by the PRISMA extension for scoping reviews (PRISMA-ScR). Results: From 728 identified articles, 18 articles were included in the analysis. Identified information for the guideline content were: introduction, aims and objectives, definition of malnutrition, prevalence of malnutrition, implementation of nutrition screening, guidance on administering items in validated tools, and guidance on anthropometric measurements. Meanwhile, format and flow charts from established guidelines served as references for the guideline development process. Conclusion: Appropriate content to develop a nutrition screening guideline has been identified based on this review. Development of a guideline based on this content can facilitate healthcare staffs to perform timely nutrition screening in older adults � 2022, Malaysian Journal of Nutrition.All Rights Reserved.",Healthcare staffs; Malnutrition; Nutrition screening guideline; Older adults; Scoping review,,"A.H.

Design: Cross-sectional analysis. Multivariable linear regression models evaluated the association between diet quality and cost for all food, food at home (FAH) and food away from home (FAFH). Setting: Daily food intake data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2005-2016). Food prices were derived using data from multiple, publicly available databases. Diet quality was assessed using the Healthy Eating Index-2015 and the Alternative Healthy Eating Index-2010. Participants: 30 564 individuals ?20 years with complete and reliable dietary data. Results: Mean per capita daily diet cost was $14�19 (95 % CI (13�91, 14�48)), including $6�92 (95 % CI (6�73, 7�10)) for FAH and $7�28 (95 % CI (7�05, 7�50)) for FAFH. Diet quality was higher for FAH compared to FAFH (P < 0�001). Higher diet quality was associated with higher food costs overall, FAH and FAFH (P < 0�001 for all comparisons). Conclusions: These findings demonstrate that higher diet quality is associated with higher costs for all food, FAH and FAFH. This research provides policymakers, public health professionals and clinicians with information needed to support healthy eating habits. These findings are particularly relevant to contemporary health and economic concerns that have worsened because of the COVID-19 pandemic.  � ",AHEI; Diet cost; Diet quality; HEI; NHANES,COVID-19; Cross-Sectional Studies; Diet; Feeding Behavior; Humans; Nutrition Surveys; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2; cross-sectional study; diet; feeding behavior; human; nutrition; pandemic,"Z.

The Strategic and Technical Advisory Group of Experts (STAGE) for maternal, newborn, child and adolescent health and nutrition (MNCAHN) was established in 2020 to advise the Director-General of WHO on issues relating to MNCAHN. STAGE comprises individuals from multiple low-income and middle-income and high-income countries, has representatives from many professional disciplines and with diverse experience and interests. Progress in MNCAHN requires improvements in quality o services, equity of access and the evolution of services as technical guidance, community needs and epidemiology changes. Knowledge translation of WHO guidance and other guidelines is an important part of this. Countries need effective and responsive structures for adaptation and implementation of evidence-based interventions, strategies to improve guideline uptake, education and training and mechanisms to monitor quality and safety. This paper summarises STAGE�s recommendations on how to improve knowledge translation in MNCAHN. They include support for national and regional technical advisory groups and subnational committees that coordinate maternal and child health; support for national plans for MNCAHN and their implementation and monitoring; the production of a small number of consolidated MNCAHN guidelines to promote integrated and holistic care; education and quality improvement strategies to support guidelines uptake; monitoring of gaps in knowledge translation and operational research in MNCAHN. � Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2022.

Objective: This study is a secondary data analysis study to identify the factors affecting working hours on health-related quality of life for people with coronary artery disease. The raw data is the National Health and Nutrition Survey (KNHANES) surveyed by the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from 2013 to 2017. Method: The subjects were 10,133 adults aged 19 or older who answered questions from doctors about whether to diagnose myocardial infarction or angina. EQ-5D was used as a tool for quality of life. The collected data were analyzed by using the SPSS WIN 25.0 program, using a stratified sample analysis method using stratification, colonization, and weighting. In the case of more than 40 hours per week and less than 50 hours, the subject�s quality of life score was high (p<.05). Results: The composite sample linear regression analysis, showed that males, the younger the age, the higher the quality of life, and the poorer the subjective health status, the lower the quality of life when the working hours per week exceed 60 hours. As a result of this study, to improve the quality of life of patients with coronary artery disease, it is necessary to develop a multidimen-sional nursing education program that includes physical, mental, and social aspects, including observing stable working hours. � @IJCRR.",Cardiovascular disease; EQ-5D; Health-related quality of life; Working hours,,"S.-J.

The present study determined the effectiveness of nutrition education modules in improving children and their mothers' knowledge on food and nutrition. Likewise, changes in attitude and behaviour among children were also determined. Methods: Five nutrition education modules were developed with key messages on healthy plate, fruits and vegetables, protein sources, nutrientdense sources of energy, and water and healthy beverages. Grades 2 and 3 students received 60 hours of nutrition education with a duration of 25 minutes per session. Students were divided into two groups: (1) nutrition education alone (n=83) and (2) nutrition education with feeding (n=83). Simultaneously, a total of nine onehour nutrition education sessions were conducted among mothers, following the same five modules taught to the students. Mothers were also grouped according to their child's group. Results: Student participants in both groups exhibited improvements in mean scores on knowledge, attitude, and behaviour (KAB) from baseline to end line. Based on results of mothers' classes, mean post-test scores of participants were significantly higher than mean pre-test scores in both groups. Group 1 had a higher increase in score from 67.2�32.8 at pre-test to 71.8�33.7 in post-test. Conclusion: The developed nutrition education modules were effective in teaching children proper nutrition. Incorporation of these modules into the K to 12 curriculum will emphasise importance of proper nutrition in early childhood. Moreover, mothers' classes can be an effective way to bridge the gap between school and community nutrition interventions. � 2020 Malaysian Journal of Nutrition.",Mothers' nutrition classes; Nutrition knowledge scores; School-based nutrition education,,"I.G.

Participants rated (strongly disagree to strongly agree) the extent to which a range of factors, independent of the energy, nutrient and ingredient content, influenced their perceptions of the healthiness of packaged foods. Two open-ended questions allowed for participants to list additional items they considered important.Setting: Online survey.Participants: Australian dietitians (n 117).Results: The greatest consensus was a positive influence of the fit within the core food groups and presence of seasonal ingredients, and a negative influence of an increasing number of additives. Mixed opinions were obtained for GM ingredients, locally sourced ingredients, labelling of animal welfare and organic certification. Nutritional indicators received a split where almost half of participants disagreed/strongly disagreed that they positively influenced their perception of healthiness. Content analysis of open-ended responses (n 53, 45 %) revealed four broad categories as important in considering healthiness: 'a whole food approach', 'marketing and labelling', 'product information' and 'context of diet'. A small number of responses (count of 6, 5 %) reported that packaging, advertising and features such as celebrity endorsement were a negative influence.Conclusions: Dietitians have a broad concept of the healthiness of packaged foods, which incorporates elements of food safety, wholeness of the ingredients and marketing.

Webpages and grey literature sources were accessed to identify corporate social responsibility (CSR) reports and commitments describing strategies to encourage healthy consumer purchases aligned with the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans. Evidence was organised using a marketing-mix and choice-architecture (MMCA) framework to characterise strategies used among eight possible types (i.e. place, profile, portion, pricing, promotion, priming, prompting and proximity).Results: Of the SNAP-authorised retailers (n 38) reviewed, more than half (n 20; 52�6 %) provided no information in the public domain relevant to the research objective. Few retailers (n 8; 21�1 %) had relevant CSR information; grey literature sources (n 52 articles across seventeen retailers) were more commonly identified. SNAP-authorised retailers in majority committed to increasing the number of healthy products available for purchase (profile).Conclusions: Substantial improvements are needed to enhance the capacity and commitments of SNAP-authorised retailers to use diverse strategies to promote healthy purchases among SNAP recipients. Future research could explore feasible approaches to improve dietary behaviours through sector changes via public-private partnerships, policy changes, or a combination of government regulatory and voluntary business actions. � The Authors 2020.",Choice architecture; Corporate social responsibility; Marketing mix; Nutrition; Obesity epidemic,"California; Choice Behavior; Commerce; Consumer Behavior; Cross-Sectional Studies; Diet, Healthy; Food Assistance; Food Preferences; Food Supply; Humans; Marketing; Nutrition Policy; Virginia; California; catering service; commercial phenomena; consumer attitude; cross-sectional study; decision making; economics; food assistance; food preference; human; marketing; nutrition policy; procedures; psychology; Virginia","B.

Athletes must understand the importance of diet and ensure that they meet the nutrient requirements to enhance sports performance. The lack of understanding in sports nutrition will lead to poor dietary practices that can cause detrimental effects on athletic achievements. This study aims to evaluate the effects of knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) regarding sports nutrition and dietary intake among young university athletes. Methods: Twenty-one local university athletes (23.8�3.4 years) were recruited, and their anthropometric and socio-demographic data were assessed. All participants attended a 1-day sports nutrition class. The KAP-Sports nutrition questionnaire was administered. Three days of dietary intake were also recorded at the same timepoints among the participants. Results: There was a significant increment (p< 0.05) in the mean scores for KAP among the participants. Total energy and total carbohydrate intakes per day were significantly increased (p< 0.05). However, overall protein and fat intakes did not improve as the readings were higher than the recommended values. Conclusion: In this study, sports nutrition education improved participants� KAP, but not the actual dietary intake. Changes in habit require more effort, with extra attention on protein and fat intakes. � 2021",and practice (KAP); athletes; attitudes; dietary intake; Knowledge; sports nutrition education,adult; article; attention; carbohydrate intake; controlled study; demography; education; fat intake; female; human; human experiment; male; protein intake; questionnaire; sport nutrition,"M.R.C.

The objective of this study is to provide insight on the potential impact of proposed purchase restrictions by comparing SNAP participant and income-eligible non-participants' expenditures on current SNAP-restricted foods, that is, hot foods, prepared foods, alcohol, vitamins and meal supplements. Design: Cross-sectional study. Bivariate analysis and multivariable regression analysis with an instrumental variables approach were employed to compare the probability of purchasing and expenditures on current SNAP-restricted foods among SNAP participants and income-eligible non-participants. Setting: National Household Food Acquisition and Purchase Survey, 2012-2013. Participants: 2513 households, of which 1316 were SNAP participants and 1197 were income-eligible non-participants. Results: Both the share of households purchasing and household expenditures on current SNAP-restricted foods were similar among SNAP participants and income-eligible non-participants. Conclusions: Results provide further empirical evidence that proposed SNAP purchase restrictions on sugar-sweetened beverages, snack foods and luxury foods are unlikely to have a meaningful effect on SNAP household food purchases. � ",Expenditures; Instrumental variables; National Household Food Acquisition and Purchase Survey; Purchase restriction; Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program,Cross-Sectional Studies; Food; Food Assistance; Food Supply; Humans; Nutrition Policy; Policy; Poverty; catering service; cross-sectional study; economics; food; food assistance; human; nutrition policy; policy; poverty,"A.

This confirms that availability of food does not automatically translate to food and nutrition security (FNS). Even when food is available it may not be accessible to everyone who needs it, and sometimes available and accessible food may not provide all the nutrients required to nourish the body to develop, grow, resist diseases, and meet ordinary physiological demands. Sometimes, food is plenty and accessible but not acceptable or sustainable. All such instances constitute potential food and (especially) nutrition insecurity. Objective: We intend to establish a theoretical framework for investigating food and nutrition security. Method: This is a theoretical paper drawing on previous publications within the scope of food security and nutrition security. Results: The review found that it is imperative to consider carefully the definition of FNS to ensure the two concepts (food security and nutrition security) are adequately and sufficiently addressed in the implementation of food policies and strategies without sacrificing one concept over the other. This balance can be achieved through a thorough needs assessment analysis following the livelihood and the vulnerability approaches to FNS. The analysis should take into account the four conceptual dimensions to FNS to holistically cover every aspect of FNS. Conclusions: The information gathered from the analysis will help prioritize and focus food and nutrition support efforts to the people who really need it, yielding impact measured in public health indicators, education, productivity and the broader national/regional economy. � The Author(s) 2020.",accessibility; availability; food security; nutrition security; sustainability; utilization,automation; demand-side management; food production; food security; global perspective; livelihood; national planning; public health; vulnerability,"K.S.

Health and nutrition claims usually influence consumers� food choice decision. Products with health claim resulted in higher perception of healthiness and nutritional value of the product, even if the product was not considered as a healthy choice. The aim of this study was to assess whether the health and nutrition claims had led to a healthier perception or better evaluation of the product among consumers. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted using an online questionnaire on 385 respondents collected through convenience sampling. The survey consisted of four parts: socio-demographic background, health awareness, understanding and usage of health and nutrition claims, and purchase intention measured through the use of a mock packaging. Data collected were analyzed using SPSS version 22. Results: Most of the respondents aged 18�30 (81.0%) and almost half of them were Malay (45.7%) with bachelor/ master or PhD qualification (60.0%). The distribution of household income for all catego-ries was almost similar (18.2�20.8%). There was a significant statistical relationship between health awareness and purchase intention among respondents (r=0.391, p<0.01). Conclusions: Health and nutrition claims influenced consumer�s perceptions and purchase intention, especially for those who were more concerned about their health, thus, more focus on policy regarding claims is needed. � 2020, Center for Academic Publications Japan.

The Model for the Provision of Good Nutritional Care in Dementia guided analysis. Barriers to food intake included distracting meal environment, rigid mealtimes, and excessively restrictive diets. Conversely, peer relationships, culturally tailored meals and celebrations, and consistent staff assisting with feeding benefited PLWD. ADSCs can support healthy nutritional behaviors and quality of life among PLWD through person-centered nutritional care.

In the meantime, FAO estimates about 1/3 food loss in the developing countries. To minimize these losses, grain storage techniques were investigated in an earthquake hit village in Kavre district of Nepal. Pesticide free moisture proof/airtight food storage bags were provided to 1,055 households using financial s upport f rom UNICEF-Nepal. Thirtythree households were identified who c ould s tore food grains f or 6-month for this study. Maize and rice grains were stored in porous and in moistureproof hermetic bags. Food grain samples were collected at the beginning and at 6-month and were analyzed for physical quality parameters, nutrients and mycotoxins. About 92% insect damage occurred in maize stored in porous bags which was prevented in triple layer hermetic Purdue Improved Cowpea Storage (PICS) bags. Insect damage in paddy remained low within 10% in both treatments. Major maize nutrient loss occurred through insect damage. The traditional practice was to use insect and mold infested maize as feed. Mycotoxins results showed that toxigenic molds develop in open storage of improperly dried grains especially maize. Fusarium-related mycotoxins associated with stunting were detected in maize samples using LC-MS/MS equipment. Mature grains should be dried sooner to processing moisture contents and packaged into moisture-proof hermetic bags (Dry Chain) to minimize postharvest loss. A clear policy implication is that use of improved low-cost Dry Chain technology should be promoted to enable quality food systems. � 2021 River Publishers.",Climate Smart; Dry Chain; Food Loss; Moisture-proof Hermetic Bags; Mycotoxins; Nutrition,Developing countries; Food storage; Food supply; Grain (agricultural product); Moisture; Molds; Nutrients; Public policy; %moisture; 'Dry' [; Climate smart; Dry chain; Food grain; Food loss; Food production; Insect damage; Moisture-proof hermetic bag; Mycotoxin; Nutrition,"D.D.

However, the heterogeneity in responsiveness to their intake frequently observed in clinical trials can hinder the beneficial effects of these compounds in specific subpopulations. A range of factors, including genetic background, gut microbiota, age, sex and health status, could be involved in these interindividual variations; however, the current knowledge is limited and fragmented. The European network, European Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST)-POSITIVe, has analysed, in a systematic way, existing knowledge with the aim to better understand the factors responsible for the interindividual variation in response to the consumption of the major families of plant food bioactives, regarding their bioavailability and bioefficacy. If differences in bioavailability, likely reflecting differences in human subjects' genetics or in gut microbiota composition and functionality, are believed to underpin much of the interindividual variability, the key molecular determinants or microbial species remain to be identified. The systematic analysis of published studies conducted to assess the interindividual variation in biomarkers of cardiometabolic risk suggested some factors (such as adiposity and health status) as involved in between-subject variation. However, the contribution of these factors is not demonstrated consistently across the different compounds and biological outcomes and would deserve further investigations. The findings of the network clearly highlight that the human subjects' intervention studies published so far are not adequate to investigate the relevant determinants of the absorption/metabolism and biological responsiveness. They also emphasise the need for a new generation of intervention studies designed to capture this interindividual variation. � The Authors 2020.

Accurate dietary assessment is essential to understand metabolic pathways/processes involved in this relationship. In recent years, biomarker discovery has become a major area of interest for improving dietary assessment. Well-established nutrient intake biomarkers exist; however, there is growing interest in identifying and using biomarkers for more accurate and objective measurements of food intake. Metabolomics has emerged as a key tool used for biomarker discovery, employing techniques such as NMR spectroscopy, or MS. To date, a number of putatively identified biomarkers were discovered for foods including meat, cruciferous vegetables and legumes. However, many of the results are associations only and lack the desired validation including dose-response studies. Food intake biomarkers can be employed to classify individuals into consumers/non-consumers of specific foods, or into dietary patterns. Food intake biomarkers can also play a role in correcting self-reported measurement error, thus improving dietary intake estimates. Quantification of food intake was previously performed for citrus (proline betaine), chicken (guanidoacetate) and grape (tartaric acid) intake. However, this area still requires more investigation and expansion to a range of foods. The present review will assess the current literature of identified specific food intake biomarkers, their validation and the variety of biomarker uses. Addressing the utility of biomarkers and highlighting gaps in this area is important to advance the field in the context of nutrition research.  � 2020 The Authors.

One way of combatting food insecurity is to increase food production and promote the consumption of balanced diets. This study evaluates the impact of small-scale irrigation technologies on food security and nutrition through food production and consumption in Robit village, Amhara region of Ethiopia. Household survey data and a farm level economic and nutrition simulation model (FARMSIM) is used to perform the analysis. A baseline scenario with minimal irrigation and current food consumption is compared to four alternative irrigation scenarios producing vegetables and fodder and aligned with four different food consumption patterns. Nutrition and food security evaluation is based on the intake per day and adult equivalent of calories, proteins, fat, iron, calcium and vitamin A. Food consumption in the baseline scenario indicates a satisfactory intake of calories from a cereal-based diet dominated by teff and maize but limited in consumption of fruits, vegetables, pulses and animal source foods. The alternative scenario under vegetables and fodder production shows the highest nutritional and economic outcomes allowing the household to purchase supplemental food items such as milk, meat, and eggs to meet nutritional needs. � Engineered Science Publisher LLC 2020.","Food security; Irrigation; JEL classification: O1, O2, O3; Nutrition; Risk; Simulation",,"J.-C.

We therefore hypothesized that this difference in associations might potentially be caused by the change in oestrogen around menopause. Our objective was to investigate associations between Vitamin D status and hypertension risk and to evaluate those associations as they may differ according to menopausal status.Design: A cross-sectional population survey conducted by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Health Statistics.Setting: The National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) 2007-2010 formed the setting for the present study.Participants: We analysed data from 2098 premenopausal women and 2298 postmenopausal women.Results: After adjustment for sociodemographic, behavioural and dietary factors, higher concentrations both of serum total 25-hydroxyVitamin D (25(OH)D) and serum 25-hydroxycholecalciferol (25(OH)D3) revealed significant dose-dependent trends with lower risk of hypertension (Ptrend = 0�005 and 0�014, respectively) in premenopausal women. In those women, 25(OH)D ? 50 nmol/l (sufficient; in contrast to deficient, Vitamin D < 30 nmol/l) appeared to have a protective effect against hypertension (OR = 0�64, 95 % CI 0�39, 1�02 for total 25(OH)D and OR = 0�60, 95 % CI 0�36, 1�00 for 25(OH)D3).

We tested a family-centered, media literacy-oriented intervention to empower parents and children 9-14 years to skillfully use media to reduce marketing influences, enhance nutrition knowledge, improve the selection of foods in the home environment, and improve fruit and vegetable consumption. Methods: A community-based, 6-U program included separate parent and youth (ages 9-14 years) sessions, each of which was followed by a session together in which skills from the individual sessions were reinforced. A pretest to posttest field test with control groups (N = 189, parent-child dyads) tested the intervention's efficacy. Results: Standardized mean differences from the multiple analysis of covariance tests showed that the intervention group demonstrated improvements on parents' use of nutrition labels (0.29), the ratio of healthy to unhealthy food in the home environment (0.25), youth's fruit (0.30) and vegetable (0.25) consumption, parent and youth media literacy skills, and family communication dynamics about food. The largest effects found were for negative parental mediation (0.48) and parents' report of child-initiated discussion (0.47). Consistent but weaker results were revealed for Latinx families. Conclusions: This family-centered approach helped family members practice using media together to make better nutrition decisions without depending on the ability of parents to limit media use. It successfully addressed the often-negative impact of the media on behaviors that increase obesity risk while also cultivating the potential for media to provide useful information that can lead to behaviors that decrease obesity risk. � Copyright 2020, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2020.",family-based health promotion; food and beverage marketing; food environment; media literacy; parenting strategies,Adolescent; Adult; Child; Diet; Feeding Behavior; Food Preferences; Fruit; Health Promotion; Humans; Marketing; Mass Media; Nutrition Policy; Parent-Child Relations; Parents; Vegetables; adolescent; adult; child; child parent relation; diet; education; feeding behavior; food preference; fruit; health promotion; human; marketing; mass medium; nutrition policy; procedures; psychology; vegetable,"E.W.

This study was performed to investigate the association between household income and brachial pulse pressure (PP) in the general Korean population. Materials and methods: This study was based on data acquired in the 2018 Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2018 KNHANES). A total of 13004 subjects at the age of 20 years or older analysed. The information on monthly household income was obtained through the questionnaire, and was stratified into 5 groups for each quintile. Brachial blood pressure (BP) was measured 3 times, and the average of the second and third measured BPs were used. PP was calculated as the difference between systolic and diastolic BPs. Results: A lower household income was associated with a higher prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors. As household income increased, PP decreased proportionally (p <.001). In multiple linear regression analysis, household income (per quintile) was independently associated with PP even after controlling for potential confounders (? = ?.125, p <.001). Multiple binary logistic regression analysis showed that the increased household income level was significantly associated lower probability having higher PP (? 43.5 mmHg) even after controlling for multiple covariates (the lowest vs. the highest household income; odds ratio, 0.48; 95% confidence interval,.41�.55; p <.001). Conclusion: Low household income was associated with higher PP. This provides additional evidence for the association between low SES and high arterial stiffness. � 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Arterial stiffness; household income; pulse pressure; socioeconomic status,Adult; Blood Pressure; Humans; Income; Logistic Models; Nutrition Surveys; Republic of Korea; Risk Factors; Young Adult; adult; arterial stiffness; article; brachial pressure; cardiovascular risk factor; confounding variable; controlled study; female; health survey; household income; human; Korea; Korean (people); major clinical study; male; nutrition; prevalence; probability; public health; pulse pressure; questionnaire; social status; young adult; blood pressure; epidemiology; income; nutrition; risk factor; South Korea; statistical model,,,Taylor and Francis Ltd.,8037051,,BLPRE,34013800,English,Blood Press.,Article,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85106241125

Secondary analysis of the National Nutrition and Physical Activity Survey (NNPAS) 2011-2012 dietary intake data included calculation of whole grain intakes based on intake from foods complying with the Healthgrain definition. These were compared with intake values where grams of whole grain in any food had been included.Setting: Australia.Participants: Australians (?2 years) who participated in the NNPAS 2011-2012 (n 12 153).Results: Following expansion of the whole grain database, 214 of the 609 foods containing any amount of whole grain were compliant with the Healthgrain definition. Significant mean differences (all P < 0�05) of 2�84-6�25 g/d of whole grain intake (5�91-9�44 g/d energy adjusted) were found when applying the Healthgrain definition in comparison with values from foods containing any whole grain across all age groups.Conclusions: Application of a whole grain food definition has substantial impact on calculations of population whole grain intakes. While use of such definitions may prove beneficial in settings such as whole grain promotion, the underestimation of total intake may impact on identification of any associations between whole grain intake and health outcomes. � The Authors 2020.",Healthgrain; Intake; Relevance; Whole grain; Whole grain food definition,"Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Australia; Child; Child, Preschool; Diet; Energy Intake; Exercise; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Nutrition Surveys; Nutritional Status; Recommended Dietary Allowances; Terminology as Topic; Whole Grains; Young Adult; adult; article; Australia; Australian; body weight; calculation; controlled study; dietary intake; dry weight; groups by age; human; physical activity; refined grain; secondary analysis; whole grain; adolescent; aged; caloric intake; child; diet; dietary reference intake; exercise; female; male; middle aged; nomenclature; nutrition; nutritional status; preschool child; young adult","K.R.

Polyphenols, as important constituents of the human diet and potent in vitro free radical scavengers, have been extensively studied for their beneficial effects on cardiometabolic health. However, it has been demonstrated that the in vivo antioxidant activity of polyphenols is distinct from their in vitro free radical-scavenging capacity. Indeed, bioavailability of nutritional polyphenols is low and conditioned by complex mechanisms of absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion. Nowadays, it is commonly accepted that the cellular antioxidant activity of polyphenols is mainly carried out via modification of transcription of genes involved in antioxidant defence. Importantly, polyphenols also contribute to cardiometabolic health by modulation of a plethora of cellular processes that are not directly associated with antioxidant enzymes, through nutri(epi)genomic mechanisms. Numerous human intervention studies have demonstrated beneficial effects of polyphenols on the key cardiometabolic risk factors. However, inconsistency of the results of some studies led to identification of the inter-individual variability in response to consumption of polyphenols. In perspective, a detailed investigation of the determinants of this inter-individual variability will potentially lead us towards personalised dietary recommendations. The phenomenon of inter-individual variability is also of relevance for supplementation with antioxidant (pro)vitamins. � The Authors 2019.",Antioxidants; Cardiometabolic health; Cell signalling; Nutrigenomics; Polyphenols,Antioxidants; Cardiovascular Diseases; Diet; Dietary Supplements; Humans; Metabolic Diseases; Nutritional Status; Oxidation-Reduction; Oxidative Stress; Polyphenols; alpha tocopherol; antioxidant; beta carotene; flavonoid; polyphenol; pomegranate extract; retinol; sinecatechins; antioxidant; polyphenol; antioxidant activity; antioxidant responsive element; cardiometabolic risk; cardiovascular disease; diet supplementation; dietary intake; dietary reference intake; epigenetics; food composition; genetic transcription; heart protection; human; in vitro study; inflammation; lipid peroxidation; Mediterranean diet; metabolism; nutrigenomics; nutrition; oxidative stress; Review; risk factor; adverse event; cardiovascular disease; diet; dietary supplement; drug effect; metabolic disorder; nutritional status; oxidation reduction reaction,"T.

Methods: All students majoring in food and nutrition (FN) at a college in Gyeonggi, Korea, participated in the survey in April 2019 (M/F = 36/106) and June 2020 (M/F -37/130) and data were analyzed using SPSS 26.0. Results: Compared to students responding in 2019, those in 2020 reported more frequently eating alone (p < 0.01) and cooking (p < 0.01), and evaluated their diets better regarding pleasant mealtimes atmosphere (p < 0.05), moderation in drinking (p < 0.05), and not consuming excessively delivery foods (p < 0.001), processed foods (p < 0.01), foods with animal fat (p < 0.01), salty foods (p < 0.01), and sweets (p < 0.01). Although the proportion of respondents who answered that they watched mukbang and cookbang at least occasionally did not change, greater proportions of respondents reported watching both genres frequently (p < 0.001, respectively) and spending less time/day in watching mukbang (p < 0.05) in 2020 vs. 2019. While they evaluated the effect of mukbang- and cookbang-watching on overall diet similarly, the proportion of respondents that reported feeling as though mukbang-watching prompted them to eat more of less-desirable foods decreased from 54.3% to 41.5% (p < 0.05). Diet improvement of participants due to COVID-19 resulted in that the association between frequent mukbang-watching and unhealthier dietary habits in 2019 was not shown in 2020. Conclusion: Our results suggest that the prolonged at-home stays due to COVID-19 might have improved many aspects of diet and decreased undesirable effect of frequent mukbang-watching in case of college students majoring in FN. � 2021 The Korean Nutrition Society This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/) which permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.",Diet; Food; Perception; Students; Universities,,"H.

Subsequent developments in proteomics and metabolomics, in addition to wearable technologies for tracking parameters, such as dietary intakes, physical activity, heart rate and blood glucose, have further driven this idea. Alongside these innovations, there has been a rapid rise in companies offering direct-to-consumer genetic and/or microbiome testing, in combination with the marketing of personalised nutrition services. Key scientific questions include how disparate datasets are integrated, how accurate are current predictions and how these may be developed in the future. In this regard, lessons can be learned from systems biology, which aims both to integrate data from different levels of organisation (e.g. genomic, proteomic and metabolomic) and predict the emergent behaviours of biological systems or organisms as a whole. The present paper reviews the origins and recent advancement of 'big data' and systems approaches in medicine and nutrition. Conclusions are that systems integration of multiple technologies has generated mechanistic insights and informed the evolution of precision medicine and personalised nutrition. Pertinent ethical issues include who is entitled to access new technologies and how commercial companies are storing, using and/or re-mining consumer data. Questions about efficacy (both long-term behavioural change and health outcomes), cost-benefit and impacts on health inequalities remain to be fully addressed.

Many adults require 2 or more classes of antihypertensive medication to achieve guideline-recommended BP goals, but the proportion of US adults taking antihypertensive medication monotherapy, versus combination therapy, has not been quantified using contemporary data. We analyzed data from 2005 to 2008, 2009 to 2012, and 2013 to 2016 National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys to determine trends in monotherapy and combinations of antihypertensive medication classes among US adults age ?20 years with hypertension taking antihypertensive medication (n=7837). The proportion of US adults taking antihypertensive medication with uncontrolled BP (ie, systolic BP ?140 or diastolic BP ?90 mm Hg) was 32.3%, 30.2%, and 31.0% in 2005 to 2008, 2009 to 2012, and 2013 to 2016, respectively (Ptrend=0.37). Between 2005 to 2008 and 2013 to 2016, there was no evidence of changes in the proportions of US adults taking antihypertensive monotherapy (39.5%-40.4%, Ptrend=0.67), dual-therapy (37.9%-38.3%, Ptrend=0.75), triple-therapy (17.6%-16.5%, Ptrend=0.36), or quadruple-therapy (4.4%-4.3%, Ptrend=0.93).

The current study examines the impact of the updated school nutrition standards on dietary and health outcomes of schoolchildren in a nationally representative data set. Design: Difference-in-differences. We compared weekday fruit and vegetable intake between students with daily school lunch participation and students without school lunch participation before and after implementation of updated school nutrition standards using a multivariable linear regression model. Secondary outcomes included weekday solid fat and added sugar (SoFAS) intake and overweight and obesity prevalence. We adjusted analyses for demographic and family socio-economic factors. Setting: USA. Participants: K-12 students, aged 6-20 years (n 9172), from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 2005-2016. Results: Implementation of updated school nutrition standards was not associated with a change in weekday fruit and vegetable intake (? = 0�02 cups, 95 % CI -0�23, 0�26) for students with daily school lunch participation. However, implementation of the policy was associated with a 1�5 percentage point (95 % CI -3�0, -0�1) decline in weekday SoFAS intake and a 6�1 percentage point (95 % CI -12�1, -0�1) decline in overweight and obesity prevalence. Conclusions: Changes to US school nutrition standards were associated with reductions in the consumption of SoFAS as well as a decrease in overweight and obesity in children who eat school lunch. However, we did not detect a change in weekday intake of fruits and vegetables associated with the policy change.  � ",Diet; Nutrition policy; Overweight and obesity; School nutrition,"Agriculture; Child; Cross-Sectional Studies; Food Services; Fruit; Humans; Nutrition Policy; Nutrition Surveys; Outcome Assessment, Health Care; Pediatric Obesity; Schools; United States; Vegetables; agriculture; catering service; child; childhood obesity; cross-sectional study; fruit; human; nutrition; nutrition policy; school; United States; vegetable","J.

Much of the supporting evidence is circumstantial or even contradictory and mechanisms underlying health benefits of specific foods are poorly understood. Colorectal cancer shows marked geographical differences in incidence, probably linked with diet, and explanations for this require knowledge of the complex interactions between diet, microbiota and the gut epithelium. Dietary fibres can act as prebiotics, encouraging growth of saccharolytic bacteria, but other mechanisms are also important. Some but not all soluble fibres have a 'contrabiotic' effect inhibiting bacterial adherence to the epithelium. This is particularly a property of pectins (galacturonans) whereas dietary fructans, previously regarded as beneficial prebiotics, can have a proinflammatory effect mediated via toxic effects of high butyrate concentrations. This also suggests that ulcerative colitis could in part result from potentially toxic faecal butyrate concentrations in the presence of a damaged mucus layer. Epithelial adherence of lectins, either dietary lectins as found in legumes, or bacterial lectins such as the galactose-binding lectin expressed by colon cancer-associated Fusobacterium nucleatum, may also be important and could be inhibitable by specific dietary glycans. Conversely, emulsifiers in processed foods may increase bacterial translocation and alter the microbiota thus promoting inflammation or cancer. Focusing on one condition is of limited value although in developing public health messages and growing evidence for impacts of dietary components on all-cause mortality is gaining more attention. We are only just starting to understand the complex interactions between food, the microbiota and health. � The Author(s), 2020.

Self-reported surveys on drug use have inherent limitations that underestimate drug use. We evaluated the performance of linking urine drug testing with a local, representative health examination survey in estimating the prevalence of drug use in New York City (NYC). Methods: We used urine drug testing from the NYC Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NYC HANES) to estimate the prevalence of drug use (benzodiazepines, cocaine, heroin, and opioid analgesics) among the study sample and compare the findings with self-reported responses to questions about past�12-month drug use from the same survey. Results: Of 1527 respondents to NYC HANES, urine drug testing was performed on 1297 (84.9%) participants who provided urine and consented to future studies. Self-reported responses gave past�12-month weighted estimates for heroin, cocaine, or any prescription drug misuse of 13.8% (95% CI, 11.6%-16.3%), for prescription drug misuse of 9.9% (95% CI, 8.1%-12.1%), and for heroin or cocaine use of 6.1% (95% CI, 4.7%-7.9%). Urine drug testing gave past�12-month weighted estimates for any drug use of 4.3% (95% CI, 3.0%-6.0%), for use of any prescription drug of 2.8% (95% CI, 1.9%-4.1%), and for heroin or cocaine use of 2.0% (95% CI, 1.2%-3.6%). Conclusion: Urine drug testing provided underestimates for the prevalence of drug use at a population level compared with self-report. Researchers should use other methods to estimate the prevalence of drug use on a population level. � 2020, Association of Schools and Programs of Public Health.",drug use; epidemiology; substance use; surveillance,"Adult; Analgesics, Opioid; Benzodiazepines; Cocaine; Female; Health Surveys; Heroin; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; New York City; Nutrition Surveys; Prescription Drug Misuse; Prevalence; Self Report; Substance Abuse Detection; Young Adult; benzodiazepine derivative; cocaine; diamorphine; narcotic analgesic agent; adult; Article; drug use; female; health survey; human; major clinical study; male; medical examination; New York; nutrition; prescription drug misuse; prevalence; priority journal; self report; substance use; urinalysis; urine drug testing; epidemiology; middle aged; prescription drug misuse; prevalence; substance abuse; urine; young adult","B.H.

Diet quality was examined using the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS), using data from a single 24 h dietary recall. Hearing function was objectively measured by audiometry assessments and hearing loss, including high- and low-frequency hearing loss, was defined as pure-tone averages at specific ranges of hearing frequencies >25 dB. Weighted logistic regression analyses were performed to examine the associations of MDS (scored 0-9, categorized at the median as ?3 or >3) with hearing loss and high- and low-frequency hearing loss.Setting: National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys 2000-2006 and 2009-2012.Participants: Adults aged ?50 years (n 1639) with valid dietary and audiometry assessments.Results: After adjusting for potential confounders, a non-significant trend for a protective association of higher MDS was observed for hearing loss (OR = 0�78; 95 % CI 0�49, 1�23). A significant inverse association was observed for high-frequency hearing loss (OR = 0�64; 95 % CI 0�43, 0�95). No association was found for low-frequency hearing loss among women; however, higher MDS was significantly associated with higher odds of low-frequency hearing loss among men (OR = 2�63; 95 % CI 1�39, 4�95).Conclusions: Among middle-older aged adults, adherence to a Mediterranean-style diet was inversely associated with hearing loss, including those at high hearing frequencies, among older adults. However, a detrimental association was observed at low hearing frequencies among men. Future investigations with a longitudinal design are needed to clarify the associations between diet quality and hearing loss. � 2019 The Authors.",Diet quality; Hearing loss; Mediterranean diet; National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey; Older adults,"Aged; Audiometry; Cross-Sectional Studies; Diet; Diet, Mediterranean; Female; Hearing Loss; Hearing Loss, High-Frequency; Humans; Logistic Models; Male; Middle Aged; Nutrition Surveys; Risk Factors; United States; aged; audiometry; cross-sectional study; diet; female; hearing impairment; high frequency hearing loss; human; male; Mediterranean diet; middle aged; nutrition; procedures; risk factor; statistical model; United States","S.A.

In autumn, to support honey bee colonies and prepare them for the winter season, beekeepers can supply homemade syrups which could contain compounds with possible negative side effects. In this study, we investigated the toxicity of one of those compounds (e.g., hydroxymethylfurfural, HMF) at doses consistent with literature data both to healthy bees and bees challenged with their most important parasite (i.e., Varroa destructor). To strengthen available data on HMF concentration in sugar syrups, we also investigated HMF formation in homemade 2:1 inverted sugar syrup, considering, in particular, the influence of temperature or boiling time on different homemade sugar syrups according to their acidity. Finally, we studied the effects of the acidity of sugar syrups on honeybee survival, and tested whether or not sucrose inversion through acidification is really necessary. We show that doses of HMF similar to those reported as sublethal in the literature appear to be non-toxic even to mite infested bees. However, the amount of HMF that can be found in homemade syrups, which increases with temperature and acidity, can be much higher and can cause significant bee mortality. Moreover, we highlighted the detrimental effect of syrups acidity on honeybee survival, suggesting that the addition of lemon or any other acidifying substance to invert the sucrose could be harmful and not necessary.

As family members share not only genes but also their diet habit, parents� salt intake may affect to their children�s obesity. In this study, we investigated correlations between childhood obesity and parents� or children�s sodium intakes based on a nationwide survey data. From the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data from 2014 to 2017, 802 boys and 657 girls aged 10�18 years, and their parents were included. BMI z-score and 24-hour urinary sodium excretion, which is estimated through Tanaka�s equation, were used to examine associations between obesity and sodium intakes. The BMI status and the prevalence of obesity between children and their parents showed strong positive correlations in both sexes (all p < 0.001). The urinary sodium excretion between children and their parents showed positive correlations in both sexes (all p < 0.05). Children with higher urinary sodium excretion showed higher BMI (in both sexes, p <0.001) and higher parental obesity compared to those with lower urinary sodium excretion, however, statistical significances of the latter relationship were varied by sex. In conclusion, our study suggests close relationship between childhood obesity and their sodium intakes, which also correlate well with parental BMIs and diet behavior. Therefore, parental education and active participation could be crucial in regulating childhood obesity. � The Japan Endocrine Society.",Family education; Pediatric obesity; Sodium intake,"Adolescent; Body Mass Index; Child; Feeding Behavior; Female; Humans; Male; Nutrition Surveys; Parents; Pediatric Obesity; Republic of Korea; Sodium; Sodium Chloride, Dietary; sodium; adolescent; Article; body mass; childhood obesity; correlation analysis; female; human; major clinical study; male; prevalence; risk factor; salt intake; sodium urine level; administration and dosage; child; child parent relation; childhood obesity; feeding behavior; nutrition; salt intake; South Korea; urine","M.J.

Nutrient profiling was applied to products to determine their eligibility to carry health claims under Standard 1.2.7. The Standard came into effect in 2013. The proportion of products carrying claims and the proportion of those not meeting the nutrient profiling criteria were calculated. A comparative analysis was conducted to determine changes between 2011 and 2016.Setting: Three large metropolitan stores from the three major supermarket chains in Sydney, Australia were surveyed in 2011 and 2016.Participants: All claims on all available products in 2016 (n 1737). Nutrition composition and ingredients were collected from the packaging.Results: Overall in 2016, 76 % of products carried claims and there were 7367 claims identified in the three food categories. Of products in 2016 with health claims, 34 % did not meet nutrient profiling criteria. These may breach Standard 1.2.7. Comparison of 2011-2016 showed a significant increase in the number of products carrying claims (66 v. 76 %, P < 0�001).Conclusions: The proportion of products carrying claims that do not meet nutrient profiling and consumers' tendency to infer health benefits from nutrition content claims warrants the regulation of all claims using the nutrient profiling. This will ensure consumers are not misled by claims on unhealthy food products.  � The Authors 2020.",Food labelling; Food policy; Health claims; Nutrition content claims,"Australia; Food Labeling; Humans; Legislation, Food; Nutritive Value; adult; article; Australia; breakfast cereal; consumer; female; food packaging; food standard; human; human experiment; male; New Zealand; nutrient profiling; prevalence; soft drink; Australia; law; nutritional value","W.L.

However, the relationship between nutrition and anxiety is unclear. Furthermore, the relationship between nutrition and BH outcomes has not been examined in a US Army Soldier population. This study sought to understand the relationship between Soldiers' nutritional intake and anxiety as well as depression. Design: This cross-sectional study utilised multivariable logistic regression analyses to examine the relationship between nutritional intake and BH outcomes. Setting: The study utilised data collected in 2018 during a BH epidemiological consultation conducted at one Army installation. Participants: Participants were 7043 US Army Soldiers at one Army installation. Results: Of the Soldiers completing the survey, 12 % (n 812) screened positive for anxiety and 11 % (n 774) for depression. The adjusted odds of anxiety were significantly higher among Soldiers who reported low fruit intake compared with Soldiers who reported high fruit intake (adjusted OR (AOR) 1�36; 95 % CI 1�04, 1�79). The adjusted odds of depression were higher for Soldiers who reported low fruit intake (AOR 1�35; 95 % CI 1�01, 1�79) and/or low green vegetable intake (AOR 1�37; 95 % CI 1�02, 1�83). Lastly, the adjusted odds of depression were lower for Soldiers who reported low sugary drink intake (AOR 0�62; 95 % CI 0�48, 0�81). Conclusions: This study is the first to examine the important connection between nutritional intake and anxiety and depression at a US military installation. The information learned from this study has implications for enhancing Soldiers' nutritional knowledge and BH, ultimately improving Soldiers' health and medical readiness.  � US Army Public Health Center, 2020.",Behavioural health; Nutrition; Public health; US Army,Cross-Sectional Studies; Health Behavior; Humans; Military Personnel; Nutritional Status; Surveys and Questionnaires; adult; anxiety; article; consultation; controlled study; cross-sectional study; dietary intake; female; fruit consumption; human; male; military personnel; public health; vegetable consumption; health behavior; nutritional status; questionnaire,"K.L.

All other cutaneous and subcutaneous diseases accounted for 0.124% of the total. In this sense, several predictors can influence the composition of the microbiome. The composition of the diet modulates the GM balance, influencing the inflammatory response. One of the first dermatoses in which the positive influence of the use of probiotics was perceived was atopic dermatitis bacteria are very important and, when the lesions worsen, an imbalance in the microbiota is detected. In psoriasis, the use of probiotics seems to help by reducing skin inflammation. Objective: To carry out a concise systematic review of the main relationships of the nutrition-gut microbiota-skin axis, highlighting the importance of nutrology and gut microbiota for dermatological health. Methods: The research was carried out from June 2021 to July 2021 and developed based on Scopus, PubMed, Science Direct, Scielo, and Google Scholar, following the Systematic Review-PRISMA rules. The quality of the studies was based on the GRADE instrument and the risk of bias was analyzed according to the Cochrane instrument. Results: It was found that in the context of the interaction of nutritional health, metabolism encompasses the interactions between diet, microbiota, and cellular enzymatic processes that generate the chemical pathways necessary to maintain life. For the understanding of the regulatory processes that involve the nutrition-gut microbiota-skin axis, chronic inflammation is a crucial factor for the development of autoimmune diseases. For example, pathological T cells residing in the skin of patients with psoriasis produce excess IL-17 in response to IL-23, triggering the production of pro-inflammatory mediators IL-1?, IL-6, IL-8, TNF- ?, and keratinocyte chemoattractants. The interaction of hormonal, neuronal, and inflammatory signaling has a major impact on skin health. Conclusion: Several studies have scientifically demonstrated the important relationship between GM and adequate nutrition for the establishment of the nutrition-gut microbiota-skin axis, highlighting the management of dermatoses with probiotics and prebiotics, as well as changes in lifestyle. � The authors(s) 2021.",Dermatosis; Gut microbiota; Nutrition; Nutrology; Skin,,"M.S.

Design: Total and main food group (n = 13) calorie intakes, percentages of animal and IPF calories, adequacy of the Dietary Reference Intake (DRI) and prevalence of chronic diseases were retrieved from scientific literature and international databases. Setting: China, 1990-2019 Participants: Overall population Results: The total calorie intake decreased by 9% over thirty years while the prevalence of chronic diseases substantially increased. Percentages of IPFs (Rule 1) and animal (Rule 2) calorie intake shifted from 9 to 30% and 2 to 30%, respectively. Meanwhile, the overall DRI adequacy (Rule 3) did not improve, with calcium and retinol deficiencies in 2019, and, although remaining above DRI, iron, copper, magnesium, and vitamins E, C and B1-B9 intakes regularly decreased. Notably, the prevalence of obesity increased five-fold, paralleling the exponential increase in IPF calorie intake. Both sources of calories were highly correlated with prevalence of main chronic diseases. Conclusions: Despite a slight decreased of total calorie consumption and rather good compliance with DRI, the farther the Chinese population moved away from the 3Vs rule during the 1990-2019 period, the more the prevalence of chronic diseases increased. Further analyses on foods� transitions will be better assessed when advocating sources/quality of calories (Rules 1/2), rather than only nutrient composition (Rule 3). � 2021 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Dietary assessment was obtained by two food diaries in children aged <10 years and two non-consecutive 24 h recalls for other age groups. TS, AS and FS intakes were estimated by using SPADE software. TS content in food was estimated at the ingredient level. AS content in food was assessed through a systematic methodology and FS was based on the WHO definition.Setting: National Food, Nutrition and Physical Activity Survey (IAN-AF 2015-2016), Portugal.Participants: Representative sample from the Portuguese population, aged from 3 months to 84 years (n 5811).Results: Mean daily intake and contribution to total energy intake (E%) were 84�3 g/d (18�5 E%) for TS, 32�1 g/d (6�8 E%) for AS and 35�3 g/d (7�5 E%) for FS. Of the population, 76 % adhered to the FS recommendation (FS < 10 E%). The lowest adherence was in children (51�6 %) and adolescents (51�3 %). The main dietary source of TS was fruit across all ages, except in adolescents which was soft drinks. In children, the main dietary sources of FS were yoghurts and sweets, soft drinks in adolescents and table sugar in adults/elderly. FS intake was lower in children with more educated parents and in adults who practised physical activity regularly, and higher among smokers.Conclusions: Interventions ought to be planned towards decreasing intakes of added and free sugars considering population-specific characteristics. � 2019 The Authors.",Dietary recommendations; Dietary sugars; Free sugar intake; Nutrition surveys,"Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Beverages; Carbonated Beverages; Child; Child, Preschool; Cross-Sectional Studies; Diet; Diet Records; Diet Surveys; Dietary Sugars; Energy Intake; Exercise; Feeding Behavior; Female; Fruit; Humans; Infant; Male; Middle Aged; Nutrition Policy; Portugal; Recommended Dietary Allowances; Young Adult; administration and dosage; adolescent; adult; aged; beverage; caloric intake; carbonated beverage; child; cross-sectional study; diet; dietary reference intake; exercise; feeding behavior; female; fruit; human; infant; male; medical record; middle aged; nutrition policy; Portugal; preschool child; sugar intake; very elderly; young adult","C.

After an in-depth study of existing dietary provisions in all community health centres, an elaborate cyclic-weekly nutritious menu was designed taking into consideration the latest recommendations (2019) by the Ministry of Family and Child Welfare, India to improve maternal health nutrition. Methods: The health functionaries from all ten community health centres of rural Vadodara were chosen for an in-depth estimation of the different meals served in the facilities. Standard measuring cups and spoons were used to measure the exact serving sizes for each person. Each meal served was supervised, checked and quantified in triplicate, while macro- and micronutrients were calculated using the Indian Food Composition Tables 2017 (Longvah et al. 2017). To bridge the gap in service delivery, two new models of cyclic-weekly menu were developed, keeping in mind the amount per mother per day as one hundred Indian rupees. Results: On average the foods served in the community health centres provided 69% of recommended energy intake, while mean recommended dietary allowance met for protein was 51%, calcium 18%, iron 50%, and fat 267%. Conclusion: The recommendations specified in this paper would improve the nutritional status of all pregnant and lactating women availing the services in rural health facilities, which would go a long way in ensuring safe and healthy motherhood. � 2021.

Since formulated feed for this purpose has not yet been established effectively, the features of live feeds in the performance of marine and freshwater larval rearing is essential. Hence, to succor growth productivity and to introduce newly livestock species into aquaculture industry, support for the stage of larval rearing must be improved and, better nutritional options must be applied. Furthermore, the natural feeding habits of fish needs live food rich in protein for improved growth, enhanced reproduction as well as survival. Common enrichment protocols, such as oil emulsion, are relatively expensive and consequently, increase overall production cost in hatcheries. The above factors have moved scientists to focus more on development of low-cost, live feed substitutions to ensure success of larval feeding in aquaculture. Larval feed performance depends directly on improvements in finding a better low-cost live feed technology for a better zooplankton and phytoplankton production. Cladocerans like Moina sp. have recently been explored as a potential live feed alternative to boost fish and shrimp larval cultivation in hatcheries. The increase in demand for fish as a source of protein for human consumption requires advancement in the development of aquaculture technologies and, emphasis is well placed on improving supply of live food organisms to assist in the larval development process. The continuous production of live food organisms is prerequisite to fish and shrimp larval growth and survival in hatcheries. � 2020 Triveni Enterprises.

For personalised nutrition advice to be effective both sides need to be considered; firstly, that factors influencing variation in response to dietary intervention are identified and appropriate advice can be derived and secondly; that these are then used effectively in the provision of nutrition advice, resulting in a positive dietary and/or lifestyle behaviour change. There is considerable evidence demonstrating genetic and phenotypic influence on the biological response to the consumption of nutrients and bioactives. However, findings are often mixed, with studies often investigating at the level of a single nutrient/bioactive and/or a single genetic/phenotypic variation, meaning the derivation of specific advice at a dietary level in an individual/group of individuals can be complex. Similarly, the impact of using this information to derive personalised advice is also mixed, with some studies demonstrating no effectiveness and others showing a significant impact. The present paper will outline examples of phenotypic and genetic variation influencing response to nutritional interventions, and will consider how they could be used in the provision of personalised nutrition. � The Author 2019.",Genotype; Nutrition; Personalised; Phenotype,"Biological Variation, Population; Diet; Genetic Variation; Genotype; Health Education; Humans; Nutrigenomics; Nutritional Physiological Phenomena; Nutritional Status; Phenotype; Precision Medicine; adult; article; controlled study; diet therapy; genetic variation; genotype; nutrient; personalized nutrition; phenotypic variation; biological variation; diet; genotype; health education; human; nutrigenomics; nutrition; nutritional status; personalized medicine; phenotype","E.R.

Severe wasting is a key contributor (12.6%) to child deaths due to nutritional deficiencies and is responsible for several morbid conditions. Objective: The purpose of this paper was to assess the impact of nutritional counseling intervention on severe malnutrition among rural under-five children in Northern India. Method: Nine villages in an ongoing project were included in the study to include all the under-five children (N=573) from these villages. Nutritional assessment was performed as per World Health Organization (WHO) child growth standards. Based on their z-scores of malnourishment indicators, children affected with severe malnutrition were included for customized health promoting nutritional intervention, other than the regular nutrition counseling sessions for all malnourished under-five children. Post nutrition counseling changes in anthropometric measurements were recorded at an interval of 6 months. Results: Significant changes were observed in mean z- scores before and after nutrition intervention that declined from -3.05 to -1.81 and -3.16 to-2.25 for weight for height (WHZ) and weight for age (WAZ), respectively. Conclusion: The results showed that the intervention was effective in community-based management of severe malnutrition among children in rural Northern India. � 2020 The Author(s).

This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of childhood blepharoptosis and associated risk factors in a representative Korean population. Methods:: This cross-sectional nation-wide study analysed the data set acquired from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2008�2012. A total of 8218 children aged 3�18 years were included. The prevalence of childhood blepharoptosis, defined as a margin reflex distance (MRD) of < 2 mm in either eye, was estimated, and the risk factors were identified using multivariate logistic regression analysis. Results:: The mean age of participants was 11.3 � 0.1 years, and 52.8 � 0.6% were boys. The overall prevalence of childhood blepharoptosis in Korea was 8.0% (95% CI, 6.9�9.1%). Boys exhibited a higher prevalence of blepharoptosis than girls at most of ages. Levator function increased with age in the normal general population. The proportion of subjects exhibiting MRD1 ? 4.0 mm also increased significantly with age (p < 0.001). Male gender, higher body mass index, and urban residency were significantly associated with childhood blepharoptosis. Conclusions:: The prevalence of childhood blepharoptosis is higher in urban obese boys.

We used the National Cancer Institute method to estimate distributions of total usual intakes from foods and dietary supplements for eleven micronutrients of potential concern and the Healthy Eating Index (HEI)-2015 score.Participants: Older adults aged ?60 years (n 2969) were categorised by sex and body weight status, using standard BMI categories. Underweight individuals (n 47) were excluded due to small sample size.Results: A greater percentage of obese older adults compared with their healthy-weight counterparts was at risk of inadequate Mg (both sexes), Ca, vitamin B6 and vitamin D (women only) intakes. The proportion of those with serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D < 40 nmol/l was higher in obese (12 %) than in healthy-weight older women (6 %). Mean overall HEI-2015 scores were 8�6 (men) and 7�1 (women) points lower in obese than in healthy-weight older adults. In addition, compared with healthy-weight counterparts, obese older adults were more likely to self-report fair/poor health, use ? 5 medications and have limitations in activities of daily living and cardio-metabolic risk factors; and obese older women were more likely to be food-insecure and have depression.Conclusions: Our findings suggest that obesity may coexist with micronutrient inadequacy in older adults, especially among women.  � 2020 Cambridge University Press.

In this context, the school has been identified as a favorable environment for carrying out health education programs. The Health at School Program and its important performance stand out. Thus, considering these discussions, they ask: How are the actions developed by the Health at School Program, focused on nutrition, being implemented? Objective: Analyze the teenager monitoring in the School Health Program (PSE in Brazil) opposite actions to the nutritional aspects of adolescents. Methods: This is a descriptive, qualitative study in Juazeiro municipality North-Ce, with the subject 18 nurses of the Family Health Strategy (FHS) inserted in the PES that municipality. Results: Nurses have limited assistance in the face of food practices, which implies in its operations; report having difficulty performing their actions outside the conventional health units and focus on strategies for a food menu. Conclusion: The monitoring of adolescents in the School Health Program ahead nutritional value is still limited to preventive practices involving specific actions, limited to a Sfood education focused on the health problem and not the needs of adolescents. � The authors (2020).",Adolescents; Nutrition; School,,"J.L.S.

Limited information is available about child-directed speech to children at biological risk of language impairments. We conducted a scoping review on caregiver child-directed speech for children with three clinical conditions associated with language impairments�preterm birth, intellectual disability, and autism�addressing three questions: (1) How does child-directed speech to these children differ from speech to typically-developing children? (2) What are the associations between child-directed speech and child language outcomes? (3) How convincing are intervention studies that aim to improve child-directed speech and thereby facilitate children�s language development? We identified 635 potential studies and reviewed 57 meeting study criteria. Child-directed speech to children with all conditions was comparable to speech to language-matched children; caregivers were more directive toward children with disorders. Most associations between child-directed speech and outcomes were positive. However, several interventions had minimal effects on child language. Trials with large samples, intensive interventions, and multiple data sources are needed to evaluate child-directed speech as a means to prevent language impairment. Clinicians should counsel caregivers to use high quality child-directed speech and responsive communication styles with children with these conditions. � 2019, International Pediatric Research Foundation, Inc.",,"Age Factors; Autistic Disorder; Caregivers; Child; Child Language; Child, Preschool; Disabled Children; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Infant, Premature; Intellectual Disability; Nonverbal Communication; Parent-Child Relations; Persons with Mental Disabilities; Verbal Behavior; audio recording; autism; caregiver support; child; human; intellectual impairment; language ability; language development; language disability; linguistics; premature labor; priority journal; Review; speech and language rehabilitation; verbal behavior; vocalization; age; autism; caregiver; child parent relation; handicapped child; infant; intellectual impairment; language development; newborn; nonverbal communication; prematurity; preschool child; psychology","H.M.

Our aim was to understand regional priorities and the context of policy development, to identify opportunities for progress.Design: We analysed documentation from a decade of regional meetings in order to map regional policy commitments relevant to healthy diets. We focused on agriculture, education, finance, health, and trade sectors, and Heads of State forums. Drawing on relevant political science methodologies, we looked at how these sectors 'frame' the drivers of and solutions to non-communicable diseases (NCD), their policy priorities, and identified areas of coherence and tension.Setting: The Pacific has among the highest rates of non-communicable diseases in the world, but also boasts an innovative and proactive response. Heads of State have declared NCD a 'crisis' and countries have committed to specific prevention activities set out in a regional 'Roadmap'. Yet, diet-related NCD risk-factors remain stubbornly high and many countries face challenges in establishing a healthy food environment.Results: Policies to improve food environments and prevent NCD are a stated priority across regional policy forums, with clear agreement on the need for a multi-sectoral response. However, we identified challenges in sustaining these priorities as political attention fluctuated. We found examples of inconsistencies and tension in sectoral responses to the NCD epidemic that may restrict implementation of the multi-sectoral action.Conclusion: Understanding the priorities and positions underpinning sectoral responses can help drive a more coherent NCD response, and lessons from the Pacific are relevant to public health nutrition policy and practice globally. � The Authors 2019.",Food policy; Non-communicable diseases; Nutrition policy; Pacific; Priority-setting,"Diet; Diet, Healthy; Humans; Noncommunicable Diseases; Nutrition Policy; Nutritional Status; Pacific Islands; Policy Making; Politics; Risk Factors; diet; human; management; non communicable disease; nutrition policy; nutritional status; Pacific islands; politics; risk factor","R.
